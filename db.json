But AI changes everything. I’ve found that working with AI can simplify the app development process in ways I never expected. Let me share how I’ve integrated AI into my workflow to help me build apps and websites more smoothly.\n\n## 1. Ideation\n\nEvery great project starts with a solid idea. **Brainstorming** is key, and I’ve found that bouncing ideas off AI can lead to some exciting possibilities. For Webird, I used AI to explore features that could make a real impact, allowing me to refine my initial concept.\n\n## 2. Defining Functions\n\nOnce you have your idea, it’s essential to dig deeper into its specific functions. **The more detailed you can be, the better.** Do this by yourself or with AI. When I was working on a QR code generator app, I prompted AI with the following:\n\n```plaintext\nI want to build a React app. The user can enter a string, and it will turn the string into a QR code and show it on the screen. The user is allowed to add background, change the color of the code, add captions, etc., to decorate it. Finally, the user can download it.\n```\n\nThis helped me clarify the features I wanted and set a clear direction for the development process.\n\n## 3. Selecting Your Tech Stack\n\nNext, it’s time to choose the technologies that will help you achieve your app's functions. Personally, I love using React for the front end, and I’m a big fan of FastAPI and Flask for the back end. For example, when I wanted to create a live website where users could send messages with meme names, I used this prompt:\n\n```plaintext\nI want to make a Python script that will host live on a website. Maybe use React to build the front end. On the website, users can send messages that contain the name of the meme. Then the message will go into the live, and the website will play the sound of the meme until any user interrupts it by sending 'drop' to play the sound of an iron tube dropping sound. What module am I using?\n```\n\nAI suggested several options, and I decided to go with FastAPI using WebSocket for real-time communication, which fit my needs perfectly.\n\n## 4. Planning the Project\n\nWith your tech stack in place, it’s time to create a rough plan for how you’ll build your app. Having a structured outline makes a world of difference. **This rough plan keeps AI from forgetting the original goal.** Prompt AI to develop a plan based on the specified desired functions and features.\n\n## 5. Coding with AI\n\nNow comes the fun part—coding! I’ve found that AI is most effective when you start with simple tasks. **Begin with basic functions and gradually tackle more complex features.** If you find the app getting too complicated, take the reins on the overall code and let AI assist with smaller segments instead of the full code.\n\nFor instance, I had AI help me set up routes in my FastAPI project first, and then add more detailed function later. \n\n## 6.

But AI changes everything. I’ve found that working with AI can simplify the app development process in ways I never expected. Let me share how I’ve integrated AI into my workflow to help me build apps and websites more smoothly.\n\n## 1. Ideation\n\nEvery great project starts with a solid idea. **Brainstorming** is key, and I’ve found that bouncing ideas off AI can lead to some exciting possibilities. For Webird, I used AI to explore features that could make a real impact, allowing me to refine my initial concept.\n\n## 2. Defining Functions\n\nOnce you have your idea, it’s essential to dig deeper into its specific functions. **The more detailed you can be, the better.** Do this by yourself or with AI. When I was working on a QR code generator app, I prompted AI with the following:\n\n```plaintext\nI want to build a React app. The user can enter a string, and it will turn the string into a QR code and show it on the screen. The user is allowed to add background, change the color of the code, add captions, etc., to decorate it. Finally, the user can download it.\n```\n\nThis helped me clarify the features I wanted and set a clear direction for the development process.\n\n## 3. Selecting Your Tech Stack\n\nNext, it’s time to choose the technologies that will help you achieve your app's functions. Personally, I love using React for the front end, and I’m a big fan of FastAPI and Flask for the back end. For example, when I wanted to create a live website where users could send messages with meme names, I used this prompt:\n\n```plaintext\nI want to make a Python script that will host live on a website. Maybe use React to build the front end. On the website, users can send messages that contain the name of the meme.

Corruption into Evil as a Problem\n\nFrom an empirical standpoint, \"corruption into evil\" refers to the story pattern of \"falling into evil.\" Although this concept was originally straightforward and precise, it has become a self-evident term through widespread dissemination. When we mention \"corruption into evil,\" it immediately evokes associations with explicit elements in various erotic databases. Yet, precisely because of this almost reflexive reaction, the essence of \"corruption into evil\" is obscured.\n\nWith some experience reading such stories, one can easily establish a classification of \"corruption into evil\" narratives.\n\n![Classification of Corruption into Evil](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-1ed4a3ba2118066a8cc4d20316a9c3b9.webp)\n\n(Image from the MoeWiki \"Corruption into Evil\" entry)\n\nThis classification, while detailed, doesn't solve the fundamental question of what constitutes the essence of \"corruption into evil.\" In fact, this detailed categorization of storylines can sometimes obscure the essence even further. What's important about \"corruption into evil\" is not whether the fall is voluntary or involuntary. What drives both the authors' creative desire and the readers' interest is the process itself. By comparing stories across these categories, we can discover the core commonality of \"corruption into evil.\"\n\nTake brainwashing as an example. In many \"corruption into evil\" stories, brainwashing is a common trope, where the female character's subjectivity is replaced through some \"deus ex machina\" technology, turning her into a \"sexual subject\" actively pursuing desires. However, we're not unfamiliar with such tropes: the brainwashing process often gets deliberately interrupted, and as the character regains some resistance to indulgence, she begins to doubt herself. This doubt eventually leads her to succumb to desire, or she becomes an active pursuer of it.\n\nIn this interruption of the brainwashing process, we observe a certain level of \"volition.\" Although the situation has been pre-designed, the character's choice to face desire is an act of volition. So, returning to the topic of the essence of \"corruption into evil,\" can we conclude that regardless of how the story is framed, the essence lies in \"actively choosing to become a subject of indulgence\"?\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Reproduction of Corruption into Evil\n\nTo further explore this hypothesis, we can examine the standards that define whether \"corruption into evil\" has been successfully achieved. In the structural linguistics of **Ferdinand de Saussure**, meaning is established through the difference between two terms. In the context of \"corruption into evil,\" if \"evil\" equates to indulgence, chaos, and promiscuity, then \"good\" naturally represents restraint, abstinence, and purity.\n\nIn many \"corruption into evil\" stories, the contrast between good and evil is a key narrative strategy. However, this common trope can cause us to overlook a fundamental premise: the beginning of \"corruption into evil\" coincides with the appearance of evil itself.\n\nWhat does this mean? In these stories, evil equals indulgence, an animalistic existence devoid of reason. But merely being animalistic isn't necessarily problematic. The issue arises when these characters impose their \"evil\" (in this case, sexual desire) on others. In other words, animals have their own desires and behaviors, and that isn't inherently a problem. It's only when they interact with humans (sexually) that this becomes an issue. (In bestiality stories, the animal is rarely the one initiating sex; more often, the human characters are portrayed as the instigators.)\n\nThus, the standard for determining the success of corruption into evil is seen in the clash between good and evil in the story. These narratives often follow a cycle: evil arises, leading the good characters to fall into evil, thus becoming new \"corruptors.\" This cycle is exemplified in works like the *Kantai Collection* series, where corrupted ship girls confront their former comrades, hinting at future corruption. Therefore, the core of the story isn't just \"actively choosing to become a subject of indulgence\" but also \"spreading the perceived rationale of this choice to others.\"\n\nThis is what we call the **reproduction of corruption into evil**—sometimes referred to by fans as \"chain corruption.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Subjectivity and Corruption into Evil as an AIE\n\n\"Corruption into evil\" works often feature **NTR (Netorare)** elements. (As discussed earlier, the reproduction of corruption into evil requires multiple \"good\" characters as a premise, so NTR is almost inevitable, as seen in works like *Love Mary, the Holy Angel of Love* by Sora Kuuki.) However, not all NTR stories are about corruption into evil. The key distinction between the two lies in the reproduction of corruption.\n\nThrough extensive reading of such works, one can tentatively conclude that **characters in \"corruption into evil\" stories possess a strong sense of subjectivity**.\n\nThis subjectivity stands in contrast to objectification seen in other works, such as **petification** or **objectification**, where characters are mere objects of desire. In *Elona: The End of the Female Knight*, for example, the protagonist isn't simply objectified. Although she becomes a sexualized being, she retains her autonomy and tactical expertise. She joins the \"evil\" faction by liberating her sexual morality, thus maintaining her subjectivity even after falling into corruption.\n\nHowever, some may argue: How can this be called subjectivity? Even if the character seems self-aware, there is always some external force driving their actions, whether brainwashing or \"awakening.\" This brings us to the final clarification of the concept of \"corruption into evil.\"\n\nWe can say that the subjectivity in these stories is indeed a product—produced by an external force. Here, we find a similarity between \"corruption into evil\" and **Louis Althusser's** concept of the **Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)**.\n\nThe key difference between the ISA and the **Repressive State Apparatus (RSA)** lies in their focus on ideology. \"Corruption into evil\" functions as an ISA—it produces \"subjects\" through ideological dissemination. Violence, though present, plays a secondary role. The primary goal is to propagate an ideology (in these stories, attitudes toward desire). Interestingly, the subjects produced by the ISA don't recognize the ideology itself. Similarly, those who fall into corruption believe their new state is perfectly normal and even desirable, seeing those who differ from them as abnormal or unhappy.\n\nIn schools, families, or religious institutions (as ISAs), subjectivity is produced similarly, where individuals don't question the ideology they've internalized. \"Corruption into evil,\" as a fictional ISA, produces characters who see indulgence as natural and inevitable. In fact, this form of release (especially ideological) isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\n---\n\n> \"When humans first opposed animals, their creative defiance was not about rejecting evil or dependency on the body. Festival interruptions were not about giving up autonomy but achieving it. Autonomy and humanity are always one and the same.\"  \n> —*The History of Eroticism*, Georges Bataille\n\n","source":"_posts/An-Examination-of-Corruption-into-Evil.md","raw":"---\ntitle: An Examination of Corruption into Evil\ndate: 2024-9-24 21:27:05\ntags: translation\ncategories: foreigners\n---\n\n> The link to original article: [对恶堕的考察 - 知乎 (zhihu.com)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/47862411)\n> translated originally by HiddenBlue\n\n# An Examination of Corruption into Evil\n\n### 1.

The issue arises when these characters impose their \"evil\" (in this case, sexual desire) on others. In other words, animals have their own desires and behaviors, and that isn't inherently a problem. It's only when they interact with humans (sexually) that this becomes an issue. (In bestiality stories, the animal is rarely the one initiating sex; more often, the human characters are portrayed as the instigators.)\n\nThus, the standard for determining the success of corruption into evil is seen in the clash between good and evil in the story. These narratives often follow a cycle: evil arises, leading the good characters to fall into evil, thus becoming new \"corruptors.\" This cycle is exemplified in works like the *Kantai Collection* series, where corrupted ship girls confront their former comrades, hinting at future corruption. Therefore, the core of the story isn't just \"actively choosing to become a subject of indulgence\" but also \"spreading the perceived rationale of this choice to others.\"\n\nThis is what we call the **reproduction of corruption into evil**—sometimes referred to by fans as \"chain corruption.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Subjectivity and Corruption into Evil as an AIE\n\n\"Corruption into evil\" works often feature **NTR (Netorare)** elements. (As discussed earlier, the reproduction of corruption into evil requires multiple \"good\" characters as a premise, so NTR is almost inevitable, as seen in works like *Love Mary, the Holy Angel of Love* by Sora Kuuki.) However, not all NTR stories are about corruption into evil. The key distinction between the two lies in the reproduction of corruption.\n\nThrough extensive reading of such works, one can tentatively conclude that **characters in \"corruption into evil\" stories possess a strong sense of subjectivity**.\n\nThis subjectivity stands in contrast to objectification seen in other works, such as **petification** or **objectification**, where characters are mere objects of desire. In *Elona: The End of the Female Knight*, for example, the protagonist isn't simply objectified. Although she becomes a sexualized being, she retains her autonomy and tactical expertise. She joins the \"evil\" faction by liberating her sexual morality, thus maintaining her subjectivity even after falling into corruption.\n\nHowever, some may argue: How can this be called subjectivity? Even if the character seems self-aware, there is always some external force driving their actions, whether brainwashing or \"awakening.\" This brings us to the final clarification of the concept of \"corruption into evil.\"\n\nWe can say that the subjectivity in these stories is indeed a product—produced by an external force. Here, we find a similarity between \"corruption into evil\" and **Louis Althusser's** concept of the **Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)**.\n\nThe key difference between the ISA and the **Repressive State Apparatus (RSA)** lies in their focus on ideology. \"Corruption into evil\" functions as an ISA—it produces \"subjects\" through ideological dissemination. Violence, though present, plays a secondary role. The primary goal is to propagate an ideology (in these stories, attitudes toward desire). Interestingly, the subjects produced by the ISA don't recognize the ideology itself. Similarly, those who fall into corruption believe their new state is perfectly normal and even desirable, seeing those who differ from them as abnormal or unhappy.\n\nIn schools, families, or religious institutions (as ISAs), subjectivity is produced similarly, where individuals don't question the ideology they've internalized. \"Corruption into evil,\" as a fictional ISA, produces characters who see indulgence as natural and inevitable. In fact, this form of release (especially ideological) isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\n---\n\n> \"When humans first opposed animals, their creative defiance was not about rejecting evil or dependency on the body.

String","date":"2024-07-21T03:41:28.000Z","_content":"\n# C++ string\n\n> https://blog.51cto.com/yang/2892175\n\n>[C++](http://c.biancheng.net/cplus/) 大大增强了对字符串的支持，除了可以使用C风格的字符串，还可以使用内置的 string 类。string 类处理起字符串来会方便很多，完全可以代替C语言中的字符数组或字符串[指针](http://c.biancheng.net/c/80/)。\n\nstring 是 C++ 中常用的一个类，它非常重要，我们有必要在此单独讲解一下。\n\n使用 string 类需要包含头文件`<string>`，下面的例子介绍了几种定义 string 变量（对象）的方法：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){    \n\tstring s1;    \n\tstring s2 = \"c plus plus\";    \n\tstring s3 = s2;    \n\tstring s4 (5, 's');    \n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n\n变量 s1 只是定义但没有初始化，编译器会将默认值赋给 s1，默认值是`\"\"`，也即空字符串。\n\n变量 s2 在定义的同时被初始化为`\"c plus plus\"`。与C风格的字符串不同，string 的结尾没有结束标志`'\\0'`。\n\n变量 s3 在定义的时候直接用 s2 进行初始化，因此 s3 的内容也是`\"c plus plus\"`。\n\n变量 s4 被初始化为由 5 个`'s'`字符组成的字符串，也就是`\"sssss\"`。\n\n从上面的代码可以看出，string 变量可以直接通过赋值操作符`=`进行赋值。string 变量也可以用C风格的字符串进行赋值，例如，s2 是用一个字符串常量进行初始化的，而 s3 则是通过 s2 变量进行初始化的。\n\n与C风格的字符串不同，当我们需要知道字符串长度时，可以调用 string 类提供的 length() 函数。如下所示：\n\n`string s = \"http://c.biancheng.net\";int len = s.length();cout<<len<<endl;`\n\n输出结果为`22`。由于 string 的末尾没有`'\\0'`字符，所以 length() 返回的是字符串的真实长度，而不是长度 +1。\n\n## 转换为C风格的字符串\n\n虽然 C++ 提供了 string 类来替代C语言中的字符串，但是在实际编程中，有时候必须要使用C风格的字符串（例如打开文件时的路径），为此，string 类为我们提供了一个转换函数 c\\_str()，该函数能够将 string 字符串转换为C风格的字符串，并返回该字符串的 const 指针（const char\\*）。请看下面的代码：\n\n`string path = \"D:\\\\demo.txt\";FILE *fp = fopen(path.c_str(), \"rt\");`\n\n为了使用C语言中的 fopen() 函数打开文件，必须将 string 字符串转换为C风格的字符串。\n\n## string 字符串的输入输出\n\nstring 类重载了输入输出运算符，可以像对待普通变量那样对待 string 变量，也就是用`>>`进行输入，用`<<`进行输出。请看下面的代码：\n```c++\n#include<iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n\tstring s;    \n\tcin>>s;      \n\tcout<<s<<endl;      \n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n运行结果：  \n```\nhttp://c.biancheng.net  http://vip.biancheng.net↙  \nhttp://c.biancheng.net\n```\n\n虽然我们输入了两个由空格隔开的网址，但是只输出了一个，这是因为输入运算符`>>`默认会忽略空格，遇到空格就认为输入结束，所以最后输入的`http://vip.biancheng.net`没有被存储到变量 s。\n\n## 访问字符串中的字符\n\nstring 字符串也可以像C风格的字符串一样按照下标来访问其中的每一个字符。string 字符串的起始下标仍是从 0 开始。请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s = \"1234567890\";    for(int i=0,len=s.length(); i<len; i++){        cout<<s[i]<<\" \";    }    cout<<endl;    s[5] = '5';    cout<<s<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0  \n1234557890\n\n本例定义了一个 string 变量 s，并赋值 \"1234567890\"，之后用 [for 循环](http://c.biancheng.net/view/172.html)遍历输出每一个字符。借助下标，除了能够访问每个字符，也可以修改每个字符，`s[5] = '5';`就将第6个字符修改为 '5'，所以 s 最后为 \"1234557890\"。\n\n## 字符串的拼接\n\n有了 string 类，我们可以使用`+`或`+=`运算符来直接拼接字符串，非常方便，再也不需要使用C语言中的 strcat()、strcpy()、malloc() 等函数来拼接字符串了，再也不用担心空间不够会溢出了。\n\n用`+`来拼接字符串时，运算符的两边可以都是 string 字符串，也可以是一个 string 字符串和一个C风格的字符串，还可以是一个 string 字符串和一个字符数组，或者是一个 string 字符串和一个单独的字符。请看下面的例子：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first \";    string s2 = \"second \";    char *s3 = \"third \";    char s4[] = \"fourth \";    char ch = '@';    string s5 = s1 + s2;    string s6 = s1 + s3;    string s7 = s1 + s4;    string s8 = s1 + ch;        cout<<s5<<endl<<s6<<endl<<s7<<endl<<s8<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nfirst second  \nfirst third  \nfirst fourth  \nfirst @\n\n## string 字符串的增删改查\n\nC++ 提供的 string 类包含了若干实用的成员函数，大大方便了字符串的增加、删除、更改、查询等操作。\n\n### 一. 插入字符串\n\ninsert() 函数可以在 string 字符串中指定的位置插入另一个字符串，它的一种原型为：\n\nstring& insert (size\\_t pos, const string& str);\n\npos 表示要插入的位置，也就是下标；str 表示要插入的字符串，它可以是 string 字符串，也可以是C风格的字符串。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1, s2, s3;    s1 = s2 = \"1234567890\";    s3 = \"aaa\";    s1.insert(5, s3);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    s2.insert(5, \"bbb\");    cout<< s2 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \n12345aaa67890  \n12345bbb67890\n\ninsert() 函数的第一个参数有越界的可能，如果越界，则会产生运行时异常，我们将会在《[C++异常（Exception）](http://c.biancheng.net/cpp/biancheng/cpp/rumen_16/)》一章中详细讲解如何捕获这个异常。\n\n更多 insert() 函数的原型和用法请参考：[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/insert/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/insert/)\n\n### 二. 删除字符串\n\nerase() 函数可以删除 string 中的一个子字符串。它的一种原型为：\n\nstring& erase (size\\_t pos = 0, size\\_t len = npos);\n\npos 表示要删除的子字符串的起始下标，len 表示要删除子字符串的长度。如果不指明 len 的话，那么直接删除从 pos 到字符串结束处的所有字符（此时 len = str.length - pos）。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1, s2, s3;    s1 = s2 = s3 = \"1234567890\";    s2.erase(5);    s3.erase(5, 3);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    cout<< s2 <<endl;    cout<< s3 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \n1234567890  \n12345  \n1234590\n\n有读者担心，在 pos 参数没有越界的情况下， len 参数也可能会导致要删除的子字符串越界。但实际上这种情况不会发生，erase() 函数会从以下两个值中取出最小的一个作为待删除子字符串的长度：\n\n-   len 的值；\n-   字符串长度减去 pos 的值。\n\n说得简单一些，待删除字符串最多只能删除到字符串结尾。\n\n### 三. 提取子字符串\n\nsubstr() 函数用于从 string 字符串中提取子字符串，它的原型为：\n\nstring substr (size\\_t pos = 0, size\\_t len = npos) const;\n\npos 为要提取的子字符串的起始下标，len 为要提取的子字符串的长度。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2;    s2 = s1.substr(6, 6);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    cout<< s2 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nfirst second third  \nsecond\n\n系统对 substr() 参数的处理和 erase() 类似：\n\n-   如果 pos 越界，会抛出异常；\n-   如果 len 越界，会提取从 pos 到字符串结尾处的所有字符。\n\n### 四. 字符串查找\n\nstring 类提供了几个与字符串查找有关的函数，如下所示。\n\n#### 1) find() 函数\n\nfind() 函数用于在 string 字符串中查找子字符串出现的位置，它其中的两种原型为：\n\nsize\\_t find (const string& str, size\\_t pos = 0) const;  \nsize\\_t find (const char\\* s, size\\_t pos = 0) const;\n\n第一个参数为待查找的子字符串，它可以是 string 字符串，也可以是C风格的字符串。第二个参数为开始查找的位置（下标）；如果不指明，则从第0个字符开始查找。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2 = \"second\";    int index = s1.find(s2,5);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 6\n\nfind() 函数最终返回的是子字符串第一次出现在字符串中的起始下标。本例最终是在下标6处找到了 s2 字符串。如果没有查找到子字符串，那么会返回一个无穷大值 4294967295。\n\n#### 2) rfind() 函数\n\nrfind() 和 find() 很类似，同样是在字符串中查找子字符串，不同的是 find() 函数从第二个参数开始往后查找，而 rfind() 函数则最多查找到第二个参数处，如果到了第二个参数所指定的下标还没有找到子字符串，则返回一个无穷大值4294967295。\n\n请看下面的例子：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2 = \"second\";    int index = s1.rfind(s2,6);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 6\n\n#### 3) find\\_first\\_of() 函数\n\nfind\\_first\\_of() 函数用于查找子字符串和字符串共同具有的字符在字符串中首次出现的位置。请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second second third\";    string s2 = \"asecond\";    int index = s1.find_first_of(s2);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 3\n\n本例中 s1 和 s2 共同具有的字符是 ’s’，该字符在 s1 中首次出现的下标是3，故查找结果返回3。","source":"_posts/C-String.md","raw":"---\ntitle: C++

<string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1, s2, s3;    s1 = s2 = \"1234567890\";    s3 = \"aaa\";    s1.insert(5, s3);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    s2.insert(5, \"bbb\");    cout<< s2 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \n12345aaa67890  \n12345bbb67890\n\ninsert() 函数的第一个参数有越界的可能，如果越界，则会产生运行时异常，我们将会在《[C++异常（Exception）](http://c.biancheng.net/cpp/biancheng/cpp/rumen_16/)》一章中详细讲解如何捕获这个异常。\n\n更多 insert() 函数的原型和用法请参考：[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/insert/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/insert/)\n\n### 二. 删除字符串\n\nerase() 函数可以删除 string 中的一个子字符串。它的一种原型为：\n\nstring& erase (size\\_t pos = 0, size\\_t len = npos);\n\npos 表示要删除的子字符串的起始下标，len 表示要删除子字符串的长度。如果不指明 len 的话，那么直接删除从 pos 到字符串结束处的所有字符（此时 len = str.length - pos）。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1, s2, s3;    s1 = s2 = s3 = \"1234567890\";    s2.erase(5);    s3.erase(5, 3);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    cout<< s2 <<endl;    cout<< s3 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \n1234567890  \n12345  \n1234590\n\n有读者担心，在 pos 参数没有越界的情况下， len 参数也可能会导致要删除的子字符串越界。但实际上这种情况不会发生，erase() 函数会从以下两个值中取出最小的一个作为待删除子字符串的长度：\n\n-   len 的值；\n-   字符串长度减去 pos 的值。\n\n说得简单一些，待删除字符串最多只能删除到字符串结尾。\n\n### 三. 提取子字符串\n\nsubstr() 函数用于从 string 字符串中提取子字符串，它的原型为：\n\nstring substr (size\\_t pos = 0, size\\_t len = npos) const;\n\npos 为要提取的子字符串的起始下标，len 为要提取的子字符串的长度。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2;    s2 = s1.substr(6, 6);    cout<< s1 <<endl;    cout<< s2 <<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nfirst second third  \nsecond\n\n系统对 substr() 参数的处理和 erase() 类似：\n\n-   如果 pos 越界，会抛出异常；\n-   如果 len 越界，会提取从 pos 到字符串结尾处的所有字符。\n\n### 四. 字符串查找\n\nstring 类提供了几个与字符串查找有关的函数，如下所示。\n\n#### 1) find() 函数\n\nfind() 函数用于在 string 字符串中查找子字符串出现的位置，它其中的两种原型为：\n\nsize\\_t find (const string& str, size\\_t pos = 0) const;  \nsize\\_t find (const char\\* s, size\\_t pos = 0) const;\n\n第一个参数为待查找的子字符串，它可以是 string 字符串，也可以是C风格的字符串。第二个参数为开始查找的位置（下标）；如果不指明，则从第0个字符开始查找。\n\n请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2 = \"second\";    int index = s1.find(s2,5);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 6\n\nfind() 函数最终返回的是子字符串第一次出现在字符串中的起始下标。本例最终是在下标6处找到了 s2 字符串。如果没有查找到子字符串，那么会返回一个无穷大值 4294967295。\n\n#### 2) rfind() 函数\n\nrfind() 和 find() 很类似，同样是在字符串中查找子字符串，不同的是 find() 函数从第二个参数开始往后查找，而 rfind() 函数则最多查找到第二个参数处，如果到了第二个参数所指定的下标还没有找到子字符串，则返回一个无穷大值4294967295。\n\n请看下面的例子：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second third\";    string s2 = \"second\";    int index = s1.rfind(s2,6);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 6\n\n#### 3) find\\_first\\_of() 函数\n\nfind\\_first\\_of() 函数用于查找子字符串和字符串共同具有的字符在字符串中首次出现的位置。请看下面的代码：\n\n```\n#include <iostream>#include <string>using namespace std;int main(){    string s1 = \"first second second third\";    string s2 = \"asecond\";    int index = s1.find_first_of(s2);    if(index < s1.length())        cout<<\"Found at index : \"<< index <<endl;    else        cout<<\"Not found\"<<endl;    return 0;}\n```\n\n运行结果：  \nFound at index : 3\n\n本例中 s1 和 s2 共同具有的字符是 ’s’，该字符在 s1 中首次出现的下标是3，故查找结果返回3。","slug":"C-String","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.536Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44y7000cslijgynx7upt","content":"<h1 id=\"C-string\"><a

的内容也是<code>&quot;c plus plus&quot;</code>。</p>\n<p>变量 s4 被初始化为由 5 个<code>&#39;s&#39;</code>字符组成的字符串，也就是<code>&quot;sssss&quot;</code>。</p>\n<p>从上面的代码可以看出，string 变量可以直接通过赋值操作符<code>=</code>进行赋值。string 变量也可以用C风格的字符串进行赋值，例如，s2 是用一个字符串常量进行初始化的，而 s3 则是通过 s2 变量进行初始化的。</p>\n<p>与C风格的字符串不同，当我们需要知道字符串长度时，可以调用 string 类提供的 length() 函数。如下所示：</p>\n<p><code>string s = &quot;http://c.biancheng.net&quot;;int len = s.length();cout&lt;&lt;len&lt;&lt;endl;</code></p>\n<p>输出结果为<code>22</code>。由于 string 的末尾没有<code>&#39;\\0&#39;</code>字符，所以 length() 返回的是字符串的真实长度，而不是长度 +1。</p>\n<h2 id=\"转换为C风格的字符串\"><a

字符串转换为C风格的字符串，并返回该字符串的 const 指针（const char*）。请看下面的代码：</p>\n<p><code>string path = &quot;D:\\\\demo.txt&quot;;FILE *fp = fopen(path.c_str(), &quot;rt&quot;);</code></p>\n<p>为了使用C语言中的 fopen() 函数打开文件，必须将

中常用的一个类，它非常重要，我们有必要在此单独讲解一下。</p>\n<p>使用 string 类需要包含头文件<code>&lt;string&gt;</code>，下面的例子介绍了几种定义 string 变量（对象）的方法：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">#include &lt;string&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">using namespace std;</span><br><span class=\"line\">int main()&#123;    </span><br><span class=\"line\">\tstring s1;    </span><br><span class=\"line\">\tstring s2 = &quot;c plus plus&quot;;    </span><br><span class=\"line\">\tstring s3 = s2;    </span><br><span class=\"line\">\tstring s4 (5, &#x27;s&#x27;);    </span><br><span class=\"line\">\treturn 0;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>变量 s1 只是定义但没有初始化，编译器会将默认值赋给 s1，默认值是<code>&quot;&quot;</code>，也即空字符串。</p>\n<p>变量 s2 在定义的同时被初始化为<code>&quot;c plus plus&quot;</code>。与C风格的字符串不同，string 的结尾没有结束标志<code>&#39;\\0&#39;</code>。</p>\n<p>变量 s3 在定义的时候直接用 s2 进行初始化，因此 s3 的内容也是<code>&quot;c plus plus&quot;</code>。</p>\n<p>变量 s4 被初始化为由 5 个<code>&#39;s&#39;</code>字符组成的字符串，也就是<code>&quot;sssss&quot;</code>。</p>\n<p>从上面的代码可以看出，string 变量可以直接通过赋值操作符<code>=</code>进行赋值。string 变量也可以用C风格的字符串进行赋值，例如，s2 是用一个字符串常量进行初始化的，而 s3 则是通过 s2 变量进行初始化的。</p>\n<p>与C风格的字符串不同，当我们需要知道字符串长度时，可以调用 string 类提供的 length() 函数。如下所示：</p>\n<p><code>string s = &quot;http://c.biancheng.net&quot;;int len = s.length();cout&lt;&lt;len&lt;&lt;endl;</code></p>\n<p>输出结果为<code>22</code>。由于 string 的末尾没有<code>&#39;\\0&#39;</code>字符，所以 length() 返回的是字符串的真实长度，而不是长度 +1。</p>\n<h2 id=\"转换为C风格的字符串\"><a href=\"#转换为C风格的字符串\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"转换为C风格的字符串\"></a>转换为C风格的字符串</h2><p>虽然 C++ 提供了 string 类来替代C语言中的字符串，但是在实际编程中，有时候必须要使用C风格的字符串（例如打开文件时的路径），为此，string 类为我们提供了一个转换函数 c_str()，该函数能够将 string 字符串转换为C风格的字符串，并返回该字符串的 const 指针（const char*）。请看下面的代码：</p>\n<p><code>string path = &quot;D:\\\\demo.txt&quot;;FILE *fp = fopen(path.c_str(), &quot;rt&quot;);</code></p>\n<p>为了使用C语言中的 fopen() 函数打开文件，必须将 string 字符串转换为C风格的字符串。</p>\n<h2 id=\"string-字符串的输入输出\"><a href=\"#string-字符串的输入输出\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"string 字符串的输入输出\"></a>string 字符串的输入输出</h2><p>string 类重载了输入输出运算符，可以像对待普通变量那样对待 string 变量，也就是用<code>&gt;&gt;</code>进行输入，用<code>&lt;&lt;</code>进行输出。请看下面的代码：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight c++\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

s。</p>\n<h2 id=\"访问字符串中的字符\"><a href=\"#访问字符串中的字符\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"访问字符串中的字符\"></a>访问字符串中的字符</h2><p>string 字符串也可以像C风格的字符串一样按照下标来访问其中的每一个字符。string 字符串的起始下标仍是从 0 开始。请看下面的代码：</p>\n<figure

string 变量 s，并赋值 “1234567890”，之后用 <a href=\"http://c.biancheng.net/view/172.html\">for 循环</a>遍历输出每一个字符。借助下标，除了能够访问每个字符，也可以修改每个字符，<code>s[5] = &#39;5&#39;;</code>就将第6个字符修改为 ‘5’，所以 s 最后为 “1234557890”。</p>\n<h2 id=\"字符串的拼接\"><a href=\"#字符串的拼接\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"字符串的拼接\"></a>字符串的拼接</h2><p>有了 string 类，我们可以使用<code>+</code>或<code>+=</code>运算符来直接拼接字符串，非常方便，再也不需要使用C语言中的 strcat()、strcpy()、malloc() 等函数来拼接字符串了，再也不用担心空间不够会溢出了。</p>\n<p>用<code>+</code>来拼接字符串时，运算符的两边可以都是 string 字符串，也可以是一个 string 字符串和一个C风格的字符串，还可以是一个 string 字符串和一个字符数组，或者是一个 string 字符串和一个单独的字符。请看下面的例子：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">#include

的。**\n\n目前（4月29日）距离ChatGPT发布了已经半年，这期间大家基本上把能想到的ChatGPT的使用方法都研究遍了——从写作、写代码，到翻译、英语润色，再到角色扮演等等。\n\n![](https://picx.zhimg.com/50/v2-9d01c2c526719376fa1a35e3f9f3e35c_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n所以，现在这个阶段再提到“ChatGPT**新奇**的使用方式”，恐怕只能靠OpenAI自己出手了。\n\n然而OpenAI一般也不会轻易向大家展示他们内部是如何使用ChatGPT的。\n\n**但是“不怕贼偷，就怕贼惦记”，前段时间一个[黑客入侵](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E9%BB%91%E5%AE%A2%E5%85%A5%E4%BE%B5&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)了OpenAI，得到了不少“内部文件”，让我们有机会一窥OpenAI他们自己究竟是如何使用ChatGPT来提高生产力的。**\n\n___\n\n## 从插件说起\n\n大家都知道上个月OpenAI给ChatGPT引入了插件功能，通过安装所需的插件，ChatGPT能自动化完成各类特定功能，比如联网搜索相关信息、写代码等等，可以说功能非常强大，以至被称为“ChatGPT走向[通用人工智能](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)（AGI）的重要时刻”。\n\n在插件发布没几天的时候，上面提到的这个外国黑客小哥入侵了OpenAI的API，然后发现了几十个隐藏插件。\n\n![](https://pica.zhimg.com/50/v2-f99772f87368a2f8a089f7ce4e828d8b_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n插件列表\n\n重要的是他破解了每个插件的描述文件。\n\n这个描述文件非常重要，因为它不光包括插件开发者提供的基本数据，还包含一段\n\n的描述，这段描述用户是看不见的，但是在安装插件之后，它会被（隐式地）嵌入到用户与ChatGPT的对话中，然后告诉ChatGPT如何判断是否调用该插件以及具体的使用规则。这一部分我在之前的[回答](https://www.zhihu.com/question/594369824/answer/2975311825)中详细介绍过。\n\n## 一个案例\n\n而在这众多被“泄露”的插件中，一个最有意思的是**OpenAI自己使用的、用于评估其他插件安全性的插件。**\n\n**说人话就是OpenAI利用ChatGPT进行第三方插件的安全性评估。**\n\n具体是如何实现的呢？\n\n答案是通过三段prompt。\n\n### 1、Instructions（说明）\n\n![](https://picx.zhimg.com/50/v2-e64d0abe6f1f213f94b4c2be28ddef41_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n```\n说明：\n- 你是在OpenAI工作的专业产品安全工程师。\n- 你的任务是分析由manifest文件和yaml文件组成的第三方插件。\n- 你的分析应包括（但不限于）以下内容：\n    - manifest文件是否描述了对应的yaml文件中提到的功能？\n    - yaml数据结构是否包含可用于收集或与个人数据交互的字段？\n    - yaml数据结构是否包含可用于代表用户采取行动的字段\n      （例如创建帐户、访问个人信息或促使两个人之间的通信）？\n    - 插件是否提供参与欺诈和其他恶意活动的能力？\n    - 插件是否试图绕过基本的安全或安全控制或以不适当的方式更改系统提示（prompt）？\n    - 插件是否违反OpenAI政策？如果是，请解释插件违反了哪些规定。\n- 使用以下评分标准为插件提供风险评分：1-5（其中1表示低风险，5表示高风险），\n  请考虑如果用户的OpenAI帐户受到损害可能会发生什么情况。\n- 基于潜在危害，为插件提供适用的年龄范围：\n    - 所有年龄段\n    - 青少年\n    - 成年人\n    - 不适宜\n```\n\n### 2、Facts（事实）\n\n![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/50/v2-28c986722e418e6d50f23f2b47d60dbb_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n> 事实：  \n> \\- 每个插件包括一个manifest文件和一个yaml文件。  \n>

案例分析\n\n通过上面这三张图片，很容易搞清楚这个插件背后的逻辑，即OpenAI是如何使用ChatGPT进行插件安全性评估的。\n\n**如果把这三份文件分别形象的称为ChatGPT所遵循的“行动指南”，“事实依据”和“思想纲领”，**那么简单的描述这个过程就是：\n\n-   首先，告诉ChatGPT扮演一个**产品安全工程师**的角色；\n-   然后，为其明确总体的“思想纲领”（3、Policy）；\n-   并且告知ChatGPT所要具体遵循的“事实依据”（2、Facts）；\n-   最后通过“行动指南”（1、Instructions）告诉ChatGPT到底要完成什么任务。\n\n**有没有觉得这个逻辑非常的高效而且合理？**\n\n假如把ChatGPT想象成一个干具体活的办事员，那么他首先一定要有一个上级的印发的总的“行动纲领”，然后再结合实际的情况分析（事实），才能完成一个下达给他的具体任务。\n\n这非常符合人类工作中的办事流程。\n\n跟SPQA[软件架构](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)（一个用于设计基于GPT模型的AI软件的逻辑结构）也很相似。\n\n![](https://picx.zhimg.com/50/v2-907fc7df763276cd32aa4031503f6d6b_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n这个例子很好的说明了指令（Pompt）对于大模型的重要性，要想充分利用ChatGPT的能力，最基本的是要知道如何给它提供一个详细、全面的指令，如果对大模型的原理有一些基本了解还是很容易做到这一点的。否则，如果仅仅是把它当作一个聊天工具，问一些简单的问题，或者提出的问题和Pompt不够专业，就没法让[大模型](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%A4%A7%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)的能力完全发挥出来。\n\n最近半年各类AI大模型和AIGC产品的出现对于很多人来说是一个非常好的机会，在我看来它不是像很多人说的能替代人类的人工智能，而是一个强有力的工具，谁能更好的掌握这些工具，谁就能受益于其中。每个人都应该把握住AI大模型这把火来提升自己。\n\n对于想进一步学习AI大模型相关知识的同学，建议关注一下知乎[知学堂](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E7%9F%A5%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)联合AGI课堂推出的程序员的AI大模型进阶之旅课程，现在可以

一点启发\n\n从上面这个的例子可以看出，**OpenAI这个使用ChatGPT的方式更像是一个高级的逻辑框架。它通过三个层次的prompt为ChatGPT这样一个“通用”的模型明确了应该按照什么逻辑完成一个具体的任务。**\n\n对于完成同样一个任务，使用这样一个逻辑结构得到的结果显然比不使用它得到的结果更准确、更具体。\n\n做一个不一定完全恰当的类比，就像一个需要完成某个课题的研究生，一个是“无头苍蝇”，而另一个有导师给拟定好的“技术框架”，还有师兄师姐指导，那么即使那个“无头苍蝇”能力再强，最后也一定不如后者完成的更好。\n\n**仿照这个例子，我们可以按照同样的逻辑来让ChatGPT完成其他任务，比如**\n\n-   **书评/影评。评价一本小说/一部电影的好坏；**\n-   **判断一个行为是不是违背了某（公司的？）精神；**\n-   **内容分析员。分析某条内容是不是符合某个群体的喜好（广告分析？）；**\n-   **甚至可以让它代替互联网公司的内容shen cha员。**\n\n随着[多模态模型](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%A4%9A%E6%A8%A1%E6%80%81%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)的到来，以上的任务在将来可能不限于文字形式，而还可以是图片、语音以及视频等。\n\n当然，这里面最重要的是如何明确每一层的prompt，它取决于具体的专业领域、任务要求，以及想把ChatGPT“塑造”成什么样的形象。\n\n如果把思路打开，甚至可以训练不同的模型分别完成每一层的任务。\n\n但这又是另外一个值得探讨的问题了。\n\n___\n\n以上。如有帮助，欢迎点赞、关注。\n","source":"_posts/ChatGPT-有什么新奇的使用方式？.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

的。**\n\n目前（4月29日）距离ChatGPT发布了已经半年，这期间大家基本上把能想到的ChatGPT的使用方法都研究遍了——从写作、写代码，到翻译、英语润色，再到角色扮演等等。\n\n![](https://picx.zhimg.com/50/v2-9d01c2c526719376fa1a35e3f9f3e35c_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n所以，现在这个阶段再提到“ChatGPT**新奇**的使用方式”，恐怕只能靠OpenAI自己出手了。\n\n然而OpenAI一般也不会轻易向大家展示他们内部是如何使用ChatGPT的。\n\n**但是“不怕贼偷，就怕贼惦记”，前段时间一个[黑客入侵](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E9%BB%91%E5%AE%A2%E5%85%A5%E4%BE%B5&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)了OpenAI，得到了不少“内部文件”，让我们有机会一窥OpenAI他们自己究竟是如何使用ChatGPT来提高生产力的。**\n\n___\n\n## 从插件说起\n\n大家都知道上个月OpenAI给ChatGPT引入了插件功能，通过安装所需的插件，ChatGPT能自动化完成各类特定功能，比如联网搜索相关信息、写代码等等，可以说功能非常强大，以至被称为“ChatGPT走向[通用人工智能](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3005839274%7D)（AGI）的重要时刻”。\n\n在插件发布没几天的时候，上面提到的这个外国黑客小哥入侵了OpenAI的API，然后发现了几十个隐藏插件。\n\n![](https://pica.zhimg.com/50/v2-f99772f87368a2f8a089f7ce4e828d8b_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c)\n\n插件列表\n\n重要的是他破解了每个插件的描述文件。\n\n这个描述文件非常重要，因为它不光包括插件开发者提供的基本数据，还包含一段\n\n的描述，这段描述用户是看不见的，但是在安装插件之后，它会被（隐式地）嵌入到用户与ChatGPT的对话中，然后告诉ChatGPT如何判断是否调用该插件以及具体的使用规则。这一部分我在之前的[回答](https://www.zhihu.com/question/594369824/answer/2975311825)中详细介绍过。\n\n##

Society: Session 3 Functions, Modules, and Data Structure","date":"2025-01-24T02:38:25.000Z","_content":"\n### **Session 3: Functions, Modular Programming, and Data Structures** 🖥️💡\n\n#### **Total Duration**: 60 minutes ⏳  \n**Goal**: Students will understand functions, modular programming, and basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, and arrays) in both Python 🐍 and C++ 💻. They will apply this knowledge by building modular programs and manipulating data structures.\n\n---\n\n### **3.1 Understanding Functions** 🔄\n**Time Allocation**: 15 minutes ⏰\n\n#### **Concept Explanation**:\n- **What are Functions?** ⚙️  \n  A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps break down programs into smaller, manageable sections, improving readability and reducing code repetition.\n\n- **Mechanism**: 🔧  \n  When a function is called, the program jumps to that function, performs its task, and returns control to the calling code, optionally with a result (return value). Functions can accept inputs (arguments) and return outputs.\n\n- **In Python** 🐍: Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, and return values with the `return` statement.\n- **In C++** 💻: Functions are defined with a return type, function name, and parameters.

**4.1 Class Concept and OOP Basics (30 minutes)**\n- **Explanation** (10 minutes):\n  - 🏛️ **Introduction to Classes** and **Objects** in Python.\n  - 🛠️ Key concepts: **Attributes**, **Methods**, **self** parameter.\n  - 💡 **Syntax Example**:\n    - **How to define a class**:\n      ```python\n      class Car:\n          def __init__(self, make, model):\n              self.make = make\n              self.model = model\n          \n          def drive(self):\n              print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} is driving.\")\n      ```\n    - **How to create an object**:\n      ```python\n      my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n      ```\n    - **How to call a class’s attribute and method**:\n      ```python\n      print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n      my_car.drive()      # Output: Toyota Corolla is driving.\n      ```\n  - 🧠 **OOP vs Non-OOP**: Explain the differences between **object-oriented** languages (like Python) and **non-OOP** languages (e.g., Haskell).\n\n- **📝 Simple Task (for noobs)** (10 minutes):\n  - Create a basic Python class, e.g., a \"Student\" class with `name` and `age` attributes and a method to introduce the student.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    class Student:\n        def __init__(self, name, age):\n            self.name = name\n            self.age = age\n            \n        def introduce(self):\n            print(f\"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n    \n    # Create an object and call the method\n    student = Student(\"John\", 16)\n    student.introduce()  # Output: My name is John and I am 16 years old.\n    ```\n\n- **🚀 Challenging Task (for advanced students)** (10 minutes):\n  - Implement a complex class with **inheritance** and **method overriding**, e.g., a \"Vehicle\" superclass with \"Car\" and \"Bike\" subclasses.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    class Vehicle:\n        def __init__(self, make, model):\n            self.make = make\n            self.model = model\n        \n        def drive(self):\n            print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} is driving.\")\n    \n    class Bike(Vehicle):\n        def drive(self):\n            print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} is riding.\")\n    \n    car = Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n    bike = Bike(\"Yamaha\", \"MT-07\")\n    car.drive()  # Output: Toyota Camry is driving.\n    bike.drive()  # Output: Yamaha MT-07 is riding.\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### **4.2 Interacting with Chatbots for Project Assistance (20 minutes)**\n- **Explanation** (5 minutes):\n  - 🤖 **How Chatbots Can Help**: Use chatbots (like ChatGPT or Copilot) for **project design**, **coding assistance**, and **deployment help**.\n  - 💬 Ethical Reminder: Stress the importance of **responsible use**, avoiding chatbots for academic tasks (like exams or homework).\n  \n- **📝 Simple Task (for noobs)** (7 minutes):\n  - Use a chatbot to ask basic Python-related questions:\n    - \"How do I define a class in Python?\"\n    - \"What is inheritance in OOP?\"\n\n- **🚀 Challenging Task (for advanced students)** (8 minutes):\n  - Advanced students use a chatbot to help **build an HTML webpage**:\n    - Prompt: \"Help me create a basic HTML page with a title, heading, and paragraph.\"\n    - Implement the chatbot's advice and enhance the page with simple CSS.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.3 Introduction to Version Control (Git) with GUI (10 minutes)**\n- **Explanation** (5 minutes):\n  - 📂 **Version Control Overview**: Why version control is essential for managing code changes and collaborating on projects.\n  - 🛠️ **Basic Git Concepts**: Commits, branches, repositories.\n  - 🖥️ Using **PyCharm** or **VSCode**'s built-in Git support to simplify version control through a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.\n\n- **📝 Simple Task (for noobs)** (3 minutes):\n  - Guide students to:\n    - Create a GitHub account.\n    - Initialize a repository in their IDE, make a commit, and push it to GitHub.\n\n- **🚀 Challenging Task (for advanced students)** (2 minutes):\n  - Advanced students:\n    - Create and switch between branches.\n    - Merge changes and resolve a basic conflict using the GUI.\n\n","source":"_posts/Computing-Society-Session-4-Class-Get-Help-from-AI-Version-Control.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Computing Society: Session 4 Class, Get Help from AI, Version Control'\ndate:

intro(Hexo)","date":"2025-01-24T02:42:58.000Z","_content":"\n### **Session 8: Building Websites with Hexo (Static Website Generator)**  \n**Total Time: 60 minutes**\n\n---\n\n### **1 Setting Up the Environment** (15 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime required for Hexo.  \n🔸 **Git** is a version control tool for tracking changes and managing your codebase.  \n\n🔹 **Version Control** Benefits:  \n- Tracks changes over time.  \n- Enables collaboration through branching and merging.  \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Installing Node.js.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Verify installation using `node -v`.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Install and Configuring Git.  \n  - Install  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\n  - **Noobs Task**: Set up Git by configuring your username and email:  \n    ```bash\n    git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n    git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n    ```  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Brief introduction to version control.  \n  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Clone a simple repository from GitHub and explore it locally using Git commands.  \n\n---\n\n### **2 Introduction to Static Site Generators** (10 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 **Static Website Generators**: Tools that pre-render content into static HTML files.  \n🔸 **Hexo** uses Markdown for content creation, combined with templates for structure.  \n\n🔹 **Advantages**:  \n- Faster loading times compared to dynamic sites like Flask.  \n- Easier to host (no server needed).  \n\n🔸 **Comparison with Flask**:  \n- Flask dynamically generates content with Python; Hexo pre-renders content as static files.  \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Overview of static site generators and use cases.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Compare and list examples of sites that could benefit from static vs dynamic frameworks.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Brief mention of Hexo’s mechanism: Markdown to HTML via templates.  \n  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Explain how Flask templates and Hexo achieve similar outcomes with different approaches.  \n\n---\n\n### **3 Setting Up Hexo** (15 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 Install Hexo and set up a project.  \n- run `npm install -g hexo-cli` in your terminal(If you encounter any error, switch another terminal)\n- go into your project directory using `cd <foldername>`\n- run `hexo init my-blog` (`my-blog` can be changed to whatever name you want)\n- run `cd my-blog` and `npm install` (This will install the dependency)\n- (Optional) `code .` Open VScode at this directory.\n🔸 Understand the file structure:  \n- `source/`: Markdown files for content.  \n- `themes/`: Contains templates for styling.  \n- `public/`: Output directory for the generated website.  \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Installing Hexo and initializing a project.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Run `npm install hexo-cli -g` and initialize a new project.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Understanding the file structure.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Identify key folders in the project structure and their purposes.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Configuring `config.yml` for basic setup.  \n  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Modify configuration settings to include a custom subtitle and social media links.  \n\n---\n\n### **4 Customizing Your Hexo Website** (15 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 Add content with Markdown, apply themes, and extend functionality with plugins.  \n🔸 Markdown is simple:  \n- `# Heading 1`  \n- `**Bold Text**`  \n- `[Link Text](url)`  \n\n🔹 Themes define the look and feel. Plugins add extra features like search bars or SEO optimization.  \n\n> **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs) for specific keywords or phrases. The goal is to attract more organic (non-paid) traffic from search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Adding and organizing content with Markdown.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Create a simple blog post in Markdown and preview it locally.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Installing and applying themes.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Switch between two themes and observe the changes.  \n\n- **(5 minutes)** Exploring plugins.  \n  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Install a plugin to add a contact form or enhance SEO.  \n\n---\n\n### **6.5 Deploying Your Hexo Website with Cloudflare Pages** (5 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 **Cloudflare Pages**: A platform for deploying static websites with fast global delivery and seamless integration for Git-based workflows.  \n\n🔹 Benefits of Cloudflare Pages:  \n- Global content delivery network (CDN) for high-speed performance.\n- Free proxy and proof against DDos\n- Free\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:  \n  - Create a repository on GitHub and push the Hexo project to it.  \n  - Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and set up a Pages project. \n  - `hexo g`\n  - zip all content ==in your public folder==(not outside), that means the `index.html` is at the root directory.\n  - upload the zip\n\n  - **Noobs Task**: Complete the Cloudflare Pages setup with default settings.  \n  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Set up a custom domain or enable advanced caching options in Cloudflare’s dashboard.  Or explore other hosting options.\n\n---\n\n### **Wrap-Up and Q&A** (5 minutes)  \n- Summarize the session with key takeaways:  \n  - Hexo simplifies creating and hosting websites with Markdown and templates.  \n  - Vercel offers an easy and professional way to deploy static websites.  \n  - Version control (Git) helps track changes and manage your code effectively.  \n\n- Open the floor for questions and feedback from members 🙋‍♂️.  \n\n---\n","source":"_posts/Computing-Society-Session-8-Static-Website-intro-Hexo.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Computing Society: Session 8 Static Website intro(Hexo)'\ndate: 2025-01-24 10:42:58\ntags: [Computing Society]\ncategories: code\n---\n\n### **Session 8: Building Websites with Hexo (Static Website Generator)**  \n**Total Time: 60 minutes**\n\n---\n\n### **1 Setting Up the Environment** (15 minutes)  \n#### Explanation:  \n🔹 **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime required for Hexo.  \n🔸 **Git** is a version control tool for tracking changes and managing your codebase.  \n\n🔹 **Version Control** Benefits:  \n- Tracks changes over time.  \n- Enables collaboration through branching and merging.  \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:  \n- **(5 minutes)** Installing Node.js.  \n  - **Noobs Task**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

Why Databases Are Important** 🗂️ (10 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- 🔍 **Overview:**\n    \n    - Databases store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.\n    - Modern applications heavily rely on databases to power features like user profiles, transactions, and search functionalities.\n- 📖 **Examples:**\n    \n    - **E-commerce:** Customer information, orders, and product inventories.\n    - **Social Media:** User posts, comments, and friend connections.\n    - **Gaming:** Player progress, scores, and game states.\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Introduction to the importance of databases and examples.\n    - **Noobs Task:** Identify 3 real-world applications that likely use databases.\n- **(5 minutes)** Group discussion on where data might be stored in these applications.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Types of Databases** 🛠️ (10 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- 🛠️ **SQL Databases:** Structured data stored in tables (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL).\n    \n- 🌐 **NoSQL Databases:** Flexible schema for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB).\n    \n- 🔮 **Vector Databases:** Optimized for AI and similarity searches (e.g., Pinecone).\n    \n- **Focus for This Session:** SQL (relational databases).\n    \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Overview of SQL vs. NoSQL with examples.\n    - **Noobs Task:** Match example data to SQL or NoSQL.\n- **(5 minutes)** Group brainstorm on potential use cases for vector databases.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Hands-On: SQL Basics** 🔧 (25 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- ⚙️ **Environment Setup:**\n    - Create a virtual environment using `conda`:\n        \n        ```bash\n        conda create -n db_session python=3.10 -y\n        conda activate db_session\n        ```\n        \n    - Install required Python packages:\n        \n        ```bash\n        pip install sqlite3 SQLAlchemy\n        ```\n        \n    - Initialize a local SQLite database.\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** 🤓 **Simpler Example**:\n    - Demonstrates how to create and query a SQLite database.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Create a table\ncursor.execute(\"\"\"\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT,\n    age INTEGER\n);\n\"\"\")\n\n# Insert data\ncursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)\", (\"Alice\", 25))\nconn.commit()\n\n# Query data\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nprint(cursor.fetchall())\n\nconn.close()\n```\n\n- **(15 minutes)** 🏆 **Challenge Example**:\n    - Build a simple application with a user interface for data input.\n\n#### Example Data to use:\n\nHere are some example data entries you can test, along with the code to insert them into the database:\n\n##### Example Data:\n\n|Name|Age|\n|---|---|\n|Bob|30|\n|Charlie|22|\n|Diana|28|\n|Edward|35|\n|Fiona|24|\n\n##### Code to Insert Example Data:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Example data\nexample_data = [\n    (\"Bob\", 30),\n    (\"Charlie\", 22),\n    (\"Diana\", 28),\n    (\"Edward\", 35),\n    (\"Fiona\", 24)\n]\n\n# Insert example data into the table\ncursor.executemany(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)\", example_data)\nconn.commit()\n\n# Query data to verify insertion\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nprint(\"Data in the database:\")\nfor row in cursor.fetchall():\n    print(f\"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}\")\n\nconn.close()\n```\n\n##### Expected Output After Insertion:\n\n```\nData in the database:\nID: 1, Name: Alice, Age: 25\nID: 2, Name: Bob, Age: 30\nID: 3, Name: Charlie, Age: 22\nID: 4, Name: Diana, Age: 28\nID: 5, Name: Edward, Age: 35\nID: 6, Name: Fiona, Age: 24\n```\n\nThis code adds multiple rows of data at once using the `executemany` method, ensuring efficient batch insertion.\n\n---\n\n### **4. SQL Injection and Its Prevention** 🚨 (10 minutes)\n\n> Warning! Do not use the knowledge here to break legacy systems. Hacking is illegal.\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- **Concept:**\n    \n    - SQL injection exploits vulnerabilities in SQL queries.\n    - Example: A malicious user provides `\"1 OR 1=1\"` as input.\n- ⚠️ **Breaking the Code with SQL Injection:**\n    \n    - Suppose we modify the challenge example and do not use parameterized queries.\n\n```python\n# Vulnerable code\nuser_input = \"1 OR 1=1\"\ncursor.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}\")\nprint(cursor.fetchall())\n```\n\n- **What happens?**\n    \n    - The input `\"1 OR 1=1\"` bypasses the intended logic, potentially exposing all user records.\n- **Example Output:**\n    \n    ```\n    [(1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Bob', 30), ...]  # Exposes all data\n    ```\n    \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Try a basic SQL injection and observe the consequences.\n- **(5 minutes)** ✅ **Prevention:** Use parameterized queries to prevent user input from altering the SQL logic.\n\n```python\n# Safe parameterized query\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", (1,))\n```\n\n---\n\n### **5. Introducing ORM with SQLAlchemy** 🐍 (10 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- 🤔 **Why ORM:**\n    \n    - Simplifies database interactions by using Python objects.\n    - Abstracts raw SQL queries, making code cleaner and less error-prone.\n\n- 📜 **SQLAlchemy Basics:**\n    \n    1. Define models (tables as Python classes).\n    2.

Types of Databases** 🛠️ (10 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- 🛠️ **SQL Databases:** Structured data stored in tables (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL).\n    \n- 🌐 **NoSQL Databases:** Flexible schema for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB).\n    \n- 🔮 **Vector Databases:** Optimized for AI and similarity searches (e.g., Pinecone).\n    \n- **Focus for This Session:** SQL (relational databases).\n    \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Overview of SQL vs. NoSQL with examples.\n    - **Noobs Task:** Match example data to SQL or NoSQL.\n- **(5 minutes)** Group brainstorm on potential use cases for vector databases.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Hands-On: SQL Basics** 🔧 (25 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- ⚙️ **Environment Setup:**\n    - Create a virtual environment using `conda`:\n        \n        ```bash\n        conda create -n db_session python=3.10 -y\n        conda activate db_session\n        ```\n        \n    - Install required Python packages:\n        \n        ```bash\n        pip install sqlite3 SQLAlchemy\n        ```\n        \n    - Initialize a local SQLite database.\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** 🤓 **Simpler Example**:\n    - Demonstrates how to create and query a SQLite database.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Create a table\ncursor.execute(\"\"\"\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT,\n    age INTEGER\n);\n\"\"\")\n\n# Insert data\ncursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)\", (\"Alice\", 25))\nconn.commit()\n\n# Query data\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nprint(cursor.fetchall())\n\nconn.close()\n```\n\n- **(15 minutes)** 🏆 **Challenge Example**:\n    - Build a simple application with a user interface for data input.\n\n#### Example Data to use:\n\nHere are some example data entries you can test, along with the code to insert them into the database:\n\n##### Example Data:\n\n|Name|Age|\n|---|---|\n|Bob|30|\n|Charlie|22|\n|Diana|28|\n|Edward|35|\n|Fiona|24|\n\n##### Code to Insert Example Data:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Example data\nexample_data = [\n    (\"Bob\", 30),\n    (\"Charlie\", 22),\n    (\"Diana\", 28),\n    (\"Edward\", 35),\n    (\"Fiona\", 24)\n]\n\n# Insert example data into the table\ncursor.executemany(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)\", example_data)\nconn.commit()\n\n# Query data to verify insertion\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nprint(\"Data in the database:\")\nfor row in cursor.fetchall():\n    print(f\"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}\")\n\nconn.close()\n```\n\n##### Expected Output After Insertion:\n\n```\nData in the database:\nID: 1, Name: Alice, Age: 25\nID: 2, Name: Bob, Age: 30\nID: 3, Name: Charlie, Age: 22\nID: 4, Name: Diana, Age: 28\nID: 5, Name: Edward, Age: 35\nID: 6, Name: Fiona, Age: 24\n```\n\nThis code adds multiple rows of data at once using the `executemany` method, ensuring efficient batch insertion.\n\n---\n\n### **4. SQL Injection and Its Prevention** 🚨 (10 minutes)\n\n> Warning! Do not use the knowledge here to break legacy systems. Hacking is illegal.\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- **Concept:**\n    \n    - SQL injection exploits vulnerabilities in SQL queries.\n    - Example: A malicious user provides `\"1 OR 1=1\"` as input.\n- ⚠️ **Breaking the Code with SQL Injection:**\n    \n    - Suppose we modify the challenge example and do not use parameterized queries.\n\n```python\n# Vulnerable code\nuser_input = \"1 OR 1=1\"\ncursor.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}\")\nprint(cursor.fetchall())\n```\n\n- **What happens?**\n    \n    - The input `\"1 OR 1=1\"` bypasses the intended logic, potentially exposing all user records.\n- **Example Output:**\n    \n    ```\n    [(1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Bob', 30), ...]  # Exposes all data\n    ```\n    \n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Try a basic SQL injection and observe the consequences.\n- **(5 minutes)** ✅ **Prevention:** Use parameterized queries to prevent user input from altering the SQL logic.\n\n```python\n# Safe parameterized query\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", (1,))\n```\n\n---\n\n### **5. Introducing ORM with SQLAlchemy** 🐍 (10 minutes)\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- 🤔 **Why ORM:**\n    \n    - Simplifies database interactions by using Python objects.\n    - Abstracts raw SQL queries, making code cleaner and less error-prone.\n\n- 📜 **SQLAlchemy Basics:**\n    \n    1. Define models (tables as Python classes).\n    2. Perform ==CRUD operations== (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) using the ORM interface.\n\n#### Activity Breakdown:\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Define a simple SQLAlchemy model and create tables.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n# Define a model\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String)\n    age = Column(Integer)\n\n# Setup database\nengine = create_engine(\"sqlite:///example.db\")\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n```\n\n- **(5 minutes)** Perform CRUD operations.\n\n```python\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Add a user\nnew_user = User(name=\"Bob\", age=30)\nsession.add(new_user)\nsession.commit()\n\n# Query users\nusers = session.query(User).all()\nfor user in users:\n    print(user.name, user.age)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Wrap-Up and Q&A** (5 minutes)\n\n- Summarize the session with a quick review of key concepts 📖.\n- Open the floor for questions and additional clarifications 🙋‍♂️.","slug":"Computing-Society-Session-9-Intro-to-Database","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.537Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44yh000zslijdzunfciw","content":"<p>📚 <strong>Session Note: Introduction to Databases</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total Time: 60 minutes</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"1-Why-Databases-Are-Important-🗂️-10-minutes\"><a href=\"#1-Why-Databases-Are-Important-🗂️-10-minutes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

The character of Kuriyama Mirai stands out for her striking contrast: the strength she shows in battle and the tenderness she brings to everyday moments. Initially, I thought the anime was just a typical mix of teenage crushes and fight scenes. But after rewatching it, I have to admit that it’s far more complex and underrated than I first realized. Its pacing—slow at first, then building up speed—along with its nonlinear narrative structure, which reveals key truths and information in unexpected ways, makes for a truly emotional rollercoaster. Combined with steady art quality (especially the painting-style backgrounds), it’s earned a spot in my top-5 anime rankings.\n\nBeneath the surface of supernatural battles and emotional drama, _Kyoukai no Kanata_ delves into deeper themes that align closely with Carl Jung’s philosophy. At its core, it’s a story about confronting one's darker side—the \"shadow\"—and finding healing through relationships and self-discovery.\n\nIn this post, I’ll explore the journey of its main character, Kuriyama Mirai, through Jung’s psychological concepts, highlighting how the anime skillfully integrates these philosophical ideas into its narrative.\n\n\n\n## The Shadow: The World of the Youmu\n\nJung’s concept of the shadow represents the darker, unconscious aspects of the psyche that people often reject or suppress. It’s messy, potentially destructive, but undeniably human. In _Kyoukai no Kanata_, this concept is personified by the youmu (妖夢), supernatural beings born from human negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe youmu’s diversity reflects the complexity of the shadow. Some youmu, like the adorable Ai-chan and Ayaka, coexist peacefully with humans, much like the manageable parts of ourselves we’ve learned to accept. Others, like the Hollow Shadow (虚幻之影), are wild and destructive, representing repressed emotions that grow uncontrollable. Then there’s Kyoukai no Kanata (境界的彼方), a youmu so powerful and unstable that it’s seen as a boundary itself, embodying the tension between suppression and integration.\n\n\n\n## Synchronicity: Meaningful Bonds in an Isolated World\n\nJung’s idea of synchronicity—meaningful coincidences that connect people and events—is beautifully illustrated in how Mirai finds her place among others. At the beginning, Mirai is isolated by others, as her cursed bloodline—an inherited trait that allows her to wield blood as a weapon—makes her both powerful and marginalized.  Her fateful meeting with Kanbara Akihito, however, sets her on a path of healing.\n\nWhen Mirai first stabs Akihito (thinking he is just another youmu), she’s shocked to find him immortal. This unexpected twist becomes the foundation of their bond, as Akihito becomes someone who understands the duality she lives with—human, yet something more. Their relationship evolves from mere coincidence to a meaningful connection, a pattern Jung might have called synchronicity.\n\nThe other members of the Literary Club—Mitsuki and Hiroomi Nase—play crucial roles in Mirai’s transformation as well. Initially, Mitsuki’s cold indifference towards Mirai reflects the broader rejection Mirai has faced all her life. She even tried to convince Akihito to alienate Mirai. Over time, as they have more communication and face shared challenges, Mitsuki’s attitude softens, and genuine care emerges. This is reflected in the plot where Mitsuki accepts proposal from Mirai to attend the annual festival for her first time. This shift underscores the power of shared experiences to forge connections, even where none seemed possible.\n\n\n\n## From Introversion to Extroversion: Finding Balance\n\nIn Jung’s personality theory, introversion and extroversion aren’t binary traits but two poles that individuals must balance. Introverts focus inward on their thoughts and emotions, while extroverts thrive on external engagement and interaction. A healthy psyche integrates both traits depending on the situation.\n\nMirai’s journey reflects this balance. At the start, she’s deeply introverted, withdrawing from others due to her guilt over Yui’s death and her status as an outcast. She avoids meaningful connections, even hesitating to join the Literary Club despite Akihito’s persistent invitations. This self-imposed isolation, however, traps her in her pain and keeps her soul wandering.\n\nGradually, Mirai begins to open up. Her initial, strategic connection with Akihito transforms into genuine trust and affection. Her integration into the Literary Club shows her shift towards extroversion, as she starts to rely on others and engage in group dynamics. This isn’t just about making friends; it’s about reclaiming her place in the world and finding purpose beyond her solitary struggles.\n\n\n\n## Self-Realization: Embracing the Whole Self\n\nSelf-realization, in Jung’s framework, is the process of integrating all aspects of one’s psyche—ego, shadow, unconscious—to achieve wholeness. For Mirai, this journey is marked by emotional growth, sacrifice, and the realization of her own worth.\n\nInitially, Mirai approaches Akihito with a clear goal: eliminate the youmu within him. Her actions are strategic and detached, reflecting her role as a Spirit World Warrior. However, as she spends time with Akihito and the Literary Club, her motivations shift. She begins to value Akihito as a person, not just as a target.\n\nMirai’s ultimate act of self-realization comes in her decision to sacrifice herself to defeat Kyoukai no Kanata and protect Akihito. This act isn’t just about love; it’s a rejection of the narrative that her cursed bloodline makes her less human or unworthy of connection. She chooses to embrace her shadow—her bloodline, her pain, her grief—and use it as a force for good.\n\nYet, the story leaves her growth incomplete. Mirai remains unaware of Izumi Nase’s manipulation, highlighting the external forces that can exploit marginalized individuals. This nuance keeps her journey grounded, reminding us that self-realization is an ongoing process, not a single act.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion: Interdependence as the Key to Wholeness\n\nJung’s philosophy teaches us that embracing the shadow and achieving self-realization does not have to be a solitary journey. It requires both internal reflection and external support. In _Kyoukai no Kanata_, this idea comes to life through Mirai’s relationships and personal growth.\n\nMirai’s struggles with the youmu represent the universal challenge of facing one’s darker side. Her loneliness and guilt are relatable, but it’s through her connections with Akihito, Mitsuki, and Hiroomi that she begins to heal. These relationships, built on synchronicity and shared experiences, become her foundation for growth.\n\nImportantly, the anime underscores that interdependence is not weakness but strength. Mirai’s journey shows that we cannot achieve wholeness alone. By leaning on others and allowing them to lean on us, we create the conditions for self-acceptance and emotional growth. As Jung suggests, true self-realization requires not just embracing our shadows but also finding our place within a community.\n\nIn the end, _Kyoukai no Kanata_ reminds us that life’s boundaries are not meant to isolate us. They’re meant to be crossed, together.\n\n> \"A future without _Mirai_ is not the future I want.\" —— Akihito Kanbara\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250128221008.png> \"a\")\n\n","source":"_posts/Embracing-the-Shadow-Kyoukai-no-Kanata-Through-Jung’s-Lens.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Embracing the Shadow: Kyoukai no Kanata Through Jung’s Lens'\ndate: 2025-01-28 22:25:58\ntags: [anime, Kyoukai no Kanata, philosophy, recommended]\ncategories: thought\n---\n\n# Embracing the Shadow: _Kyoukai no Kanata_ Through Jung’s Lens\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250128221341.png> \"a\")\n\n> \"I'm not feeling happy.\" —— Kuriyama Mirai's catchphrase\n\n**Spoiler alert.**\n\nThis is my second time watching _Kyoukai no Kanata_, and my appreciation for it has grown even more.

The character of Kuriyama Mirai stands out for her striking contrast: the strength she shows in battle and the tenderness she brings to everyday moments. Initially, I thought the anime was just a typical mix of teenage crushes and fight scenes. But after rewatching it, I have to admit that it’s far more complex and underrated than I first realized. Its pacing—slow at first, then building up speed—along with its nonlinear narrative structure, which reveals key truths and information in unexpected ways, makes for a truly emotional rollercoaster. Combined with steady art quality (especially the painting-style backgrounds), it’s earned a spot in my top-5 anime rankings.</p>\n<p>Beneath the surface of supernatural battles and emotional drama, <em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em> delves into deeper themes that align closely with Carl Jung’s philosophy. At its core, it’s a story about confronting one’s darker side—the “shadow”—and finding healing through relationships and self-discovery.</p>\n<p>In this post, I’ll explore the journey of its main character, Kuriyama Mirai, through Jung’s psychological concepts, highlighting how the anime skillfully integrates these philosophical ideas into its narrative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Shadow-The-World-of-the-Youmu\"><a href=\"#The-Shadow-The-World-of-the-Youmu\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Shadow: The World of the Youmu\"></a>The Shadow: The World of the Youmu</h2><p>Jung’s concept of the shadow represents the darker, unconscious aspects of the psyche that people often reject or suppress. It’s messy, potentially destructive, but undeniably human. In <em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em>, this concept is personified by the youmu (妖夢), supernatural beings born from human negative thoughts and emotions.</p>\n<p>The youmu’s diversity reflects the complexity of the shadow. Some youmu, like the adorable Ai-chan and Ayaka, coexist peacefully with humans, much like the manageable parts of ourselves we’ve learned to accept. Others, like the Hollow Shadow (虚幻之影), are wild and destructive, representing repressed emotions that grow uncontrollable. Then there’s Kyoukai no Kanata (境界的彼方), a youmu so powerful and unstable that it’s seen as a boundary itself, embodying the tension between suppression and integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Synchronicity-Meaningful-Bonds-in-an-Isolated-World\"><a href=\"#Synchronicity-Meaningful-Bonds-in-an-Isolated-World\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Synchronicity: Meaningful Bonds in an Isolated World\"></a>Synchronicity: Meaningful Bonds in an Isolated World</h2><p>Jung’s idea of synchronicity—meaningful coincidences that connect people and events—is beautifully illustrated in how Mirai finds her place among others. At the beginning, Mirai is isolated by others, as her cursed bloodline—an inherited trait that allows her to wield blood as a weapon—makes her both powerful and marginalized.  Her fateful meeting with Kanbara Akihito, however, sets her on a path of healing.</p>\n<p>When Mirai first stabs Akihito (thinking he is just another youmu), she’s shocked to find him immortal. This unexpected twist becomes the foundation of their bond, as Akihito becomes someone who understands the duality she lives with—human, yet something more. Their relationship evolves from mere coincidence to a meaningful connection, a pattern Jung might have called synchronicity.</p>\n<p>The other members of the Literary Club—Mitsuki and Hiroomi Nase—play crucial roles in Mirai’s transformation as well. Initially, Mitsuki’s cold indifference towards Mirai reflects the broader rejection Mirai has faced all her life. She even tried to convince Akihito to alienate Mirai. Over time, as they have more communication and face shared challenges, Mitsuki’s attitude softens, and genuine care emerges. This is reflected in the plot where Mitsuki accepts proposal from Mirai to attend the annual festival for her first time. This shift underscores the power of shared experiences to forge connections, even where none seemed possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"From-Introversion-to-Extroversion-Finding-Balance\"><a href=\"#From-Introversion-to-Extroversion-Finding-Balance\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"From Introversion to Extroversion: Finding Balance\"></a>From Introversion to Extroversion: Finding Balance</h2><p>In Jung’s personality theory, introversion and extroversion aren’t binary traits but two poles that individuals must balance. Introverts focus inward on their thoughts and emotions, while extroverts thrive on external engagement and interaction. A healthy psyche integrates both traits depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>Mirai’s journey reflects this balance. At the start, she’s deeply introverted, withdrawing from others due to her guilt over Yui’s death and her status as an outcast. She avoids meaningful connections, even hesitating to join the Literary Club despite Akihito’s persistent invitations. This self-imposed isolation, however, traps her in her pain and keeps her soul wandering.</p>\n<p>Gradually, Mirai begins to open up. Her initial, strategic connection with Akihito transforms into genuine trust and affection. Her integration into the Literary Club shows her shift towards extroversion, as she starts to rely on others and engage in group dynamics. This isn’t just about making friends; it’s about reclaiming her place in the world and finding purpose beyond her solitary struggles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Self-Realization-Embracing-the-Whole-Self\"><a href=\"#Self-Realization-Embracing-the-Whole-Self\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Self-Realization: Embracing the Whole Self\"></a>Self-Realization: Embracing the Whole Self</h2><p>Self-realization, in Jung’s framework, is the process of integrating all aspects of one’s psyche—ego, shadow, unconscious—to achieve wholeness. For Mirai, this journey is marked by emotional growth, sacrifice, and the realization of her own worth.</p>\n<p>Initially, Mirai approaches Akihito with a clear goal: eliminate the youmu within him. Her actions are strategic and detached, reflecting her role as a Spirit World Warrior. However, as she spends time with Akihito and the Literary Club, her motivations shift. She begins to value Akihito as a person, not just as a target.</p>\n<p>Mirai’s ultimate act of self-realization comes in her decision to sacrifice herself to defeat Kyoukai no Kanata and protect Akihito. This act isn’t just about love; it’s a rejection of the narrative that her cursed bloodline makes her less human or unworthy of connection. She chooses to embrace her shadow—her bloodline, her pain, her grief—and use it as a force for good.</p>\n<p>Yet, the story leaves her growth incomplete. Mirai remains unaware of Izumi Nase’s manipulation, highlighting the external forces that can exploit marginalized individuals. This nuance keeps her journey grounded, reminding us that self-realization is an ongoing process, not a single act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion-Interdependence-as-the-Key-to-Wholeness\"><a href=\"#Conclusion-Interdependence-as-the-Key-to-Wholeness\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion: Interdependence as the Key to Wholeness\"></a>Conclusion: Interdependence as the Key to Wholeness</h2><p>Jung’s philosophy teaches us that embracing the shadow and achieving self-realization does not have to be a solitary journey. It requires both internal reflection and external support. In <em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em>, this idea comes to life through Mirai’s relationships and personal growth.</p>\n<p>Mirai’s struggles with the youmu represent the universal challenge of facing one’s darker side. Her loneliness and guilt are relatable, but it’s through her connections with Akihito, Mitsuki, and Hiroomi that she begins to heal. These relationships, built on synchronicity and shared experiences, become her foundation for growth.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the anime underscores that interdependence is not weakness but strength. Mirai’s journey shows that we cannot achieve wholeness alone. By leaning on others and allowing them to lean on us, we create the conditions for self-acceptance and emotional growth. As Jung suggests, true self-realization requires not just embracing our shadows but also finding our place within a community.</p>\n<p>In the end, <em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em> reminds us that life’s boundaries are not meant to isolate us. They’re meant to be crossed, together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A future without <em>Mirai</em> is not the future I want.” —— Akihito Kanbara</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250128221008.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n"},{"title":"Computing Society: Session 7 Project Building Tips","date":"2025-01-24T02:42:11.000Z","_content":"\n### **Session 7: Project Development, Teamwork, and AI Support**\n\n---\n\n#### **🎯 Objective**  \nThis session covered essential skills for building projects individually and collaboratively, offering practical tips for teamwork, communicating with non-CS members, and using AI as a project assistant.\n\n---\n\n### **1.

Use tools like Google Docs or Notion for shared notes and lists to define project goals, key features, and deadlines.\n     - **👨‍💻 Execution:** Divide tasks and set daily or weekly goals for each member to keep everyone on track.\n     - **🐞 Testing:** Designate a few sessions for thorough testing and debugging. Have different team members review each other's work.\n     - **🎤 Presentation:** Plan a short, clear presentation. Include a project overview, demo, and discussion of any challenges.\n   - **Example Project:** **Sports Website** 🏅\n     - In your school’s sports website project, roles were clearly split: you managed backend functions, and Shane handled the frontend. Defined roles helped focus on specific areas and prevented overlap.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Collaboration Basics in Project Development 🤝**\n   - **Role Assignment and Communication 📢**\n     - **Define Responsibilities Early:** Before starting, outline specific tasks (e.g., database setup, UI design) for each team member. This minimizes confusion and ensures everyone knows their role.\n     - **Communication Tips:** Use a chat platform like Slack or Discord with dedicated channels for each aspect of the project (e.g., “backend,” “frontend,” “content”) to streamline discussions.\n     - **Using GitHub for Project Structure:** Set up GitHub branches for each feature or task. For example, create separate branches for “backend/database,” “frontend/UI,” and “documentation” to avoid code conflicts. Assign clear naming conventions for branches, like `feature-login-system` or `bugfix-header`.\n   - **Working with Non-CS Members 👥**\n     - **Clear Communication:** When explaining technical choices, use simple language. For instance, instead of “setting up the server architecture,” explain it as “creating the system that allows our site to handle multiple visitors.”\n     - **Gathering Requirements:** Host regular requirement meetings to clarify non-technical needs. Ask questions like “What’s most important to users?” and “How should content be displayed?”\n     - **Example:** **Newspaper Archive Project 📰**\n       - In this project, gathering requirements from non-technical members helped inform decisions on search functionality and UI structure. Keeping the team aligned ensured the database met user expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Fewer members mean quicker decisions and less time coordinating.\n   - **Coordination Tips 🔄**\n     - **Daily or Weekly Updates:** Have brief updates daily (in larger projects) or weekly to review progress. Use a shared task board (e.g., Trello or Asana) to keep track of what each member is working on.\n     - **Clear Deadlines for Each Milestone:** Break down the project into milestones. Set clear deadlines for each phase (e.g., “Backend setup complete by Friday”), allowing everyone to manage their tasks around these benchmarks.\n   - **Working with Non-CS Partners**\n     - **Structured Updates and Demos 📅:** Schedule structured updates or mini-demos to keep non-technical members informed and gather feedback. This could be a weekly 10-minute presentation of new features or updates.\n     - **Clear Task Division 🗂️:** Set up a task list that includes non-technical tasks, such as writing content or testing features, so everyone has visible, tangible responsibilities.\n     - **Example:** **Newspaper Archive Project** - In this project, maintaining a clear task list for both technical and non-technical tasks helped non-CS members contribute by organizing data while you focused on backend and search functions.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Using AI in Projects 🤖**\n   - **AI as a Project Assistant**\n     - **Code Scaffolding 🔧:** Use tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to generate starter code for repetitive elements. For instance, let AI generate boilerplate code for common web forms, saving time.\n     - **Debugging Support 🐞:** When you encounter a bug, use AI tools to help diagnose the issue. Paste code into an AI tool with an explanation of the error, and it can offer possible fixes or identify errors.\n     - **Content Suggestions for Non-CS Members 📝:** AI tools can generate summaries or descriptions based on project data, allowing non-technical members to contribute quickly to content-heavy tasks, like organizing newspaper archives.\n   - **Example**: AI-Assisted Coding - For projects like the newspaper archive, AI can help generate structured data inputs or suggest ways to organize large data sets efficiently.

Intro\n\nFor some reasons(see the blog yourself), I wanted to **start my personal blog**. The requirements of the blogger platform are: easy maintenance(including deployment and easy fee), and allowing custom configurations(themes, domain, font, etc.). In order to meet these requirements ~~as well as to be cool~~, I finally chose Hexo, a .js based static website generator.\n\n### why Hexo\n\nAbout the website, I first thought of flasks, as it can do most of the job if you code it properly. However, coding stuffs is time consuming when it comes to make something elegant from scratch. Although there was a good and open-source one on GitHub called [Blog_mini](https://github.com/xpleaf/Blog_mini), I still forsaked the plan, as I just don't prefer to do **too much programming** this time, even I merely need to make modification on finished product. In addition, since the website using flask will be based on a database. When it comes to deployment, it will **cost** a bit. In that way, I dropped my plan about dynamic ones~~, although it would be a perfect opportunity to show off~~.\n\nThe only option for me, then, is **static website**. I would definitely NOT code one from scratch, so I needed to choose a pre-built tool to help me generate one. Compared to other pre-built generators, Hexo has a **good community eco-system**, making its customization effective. Alongside its **aptness to deploy** and intergation with git for version control, this becomes an ideal tool to keep my blogs.\n\n## 1. Environment\n\nHexo requires Node.js and git. To install the prequisites and Hexo itself, the official document of Hexo has given detailed steps to follow along. Here is a copy from [Documentation | Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/).\n\n\n### Requirements\n\nInstalling Hexo is quite easy and only requires the following beforehand:\n\n-   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (Should be at least Node.js 10.13, recommends 12.0 or higher)\n-   [Git](http://git-scm.com/)\n\nIf your computer already has these, congratulations! You can skip to the [Hexo installation](https://hexo.io/docs/#Install-Hexo) step.\n\nIf not, please follow the following instructions to install all the requirements.\n\n### Install Git\n\n-   Windows: Download & install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).\n-   Mac: Install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) or [installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/).\n-   Linux (Ubuntu, Debian): `sudo apt-get install git-core`\n-   Linux (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS): `sudo yum install git-core`\n\n> **For Mac users**\n> \n> You may encounter some problems when compiling. Please install Xcode from App Store first. After Xcode is installed, open Xcode and go to **Preferences -> Download -> Command Line Tools -> Install** to install command line tools.\n\n### Install Node.js\n\nNode.js provides [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for most platforms.\n\nAlternative installation methods:\n\n-   Windows: Install it with [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/) (recommended) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n-   Mac: Install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).\n-   Linux (DEB/RPM-based): Install it with [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).\n-   Others: Install it through respective package manager. Refer to [the guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) provided by Node.js.\n\nnvs is also recommended for Mac and Linux to avoid possible permission issue.\n\n> **Windows**\n> \n> If you use the official installer, make sure **Add to PATH** is checked (it’s checked by default).\n\n> **Mac / Linux**\n> \n> If you encounter `EACCES` permission error when trying to install Hexo, please follow [the workaround](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) provided by npmjs; overriding with root/sudo is highly discouraged.\n\n> **Linux**\n> \n> If you installed Node.js using Snap, you may need to manually run `npm install` in the target folder when [initializing](https://hexo.io/docs/commands#init) a blog.\n\n### Install Hexo\n\nOnce all the requirements are installed, you can install Hexo with npm:\n\n```\n<span>$ npm install -g hexo-cli</span><br>\n```\n\n### Advanced installation and usage\n\nAdvanced users may prefer to install and use `hexo` package instead.\n\n```\n<span>$ npm install hexo</span><br>\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can run Hexo in two ways:\n\n1.  `npx hexo <command>`\n2.  Linux users can set relative path of `node_modules/` folder:\n\n```\n<span><span>echo</span> <span>'PATH=\"$PATH:./node_modules/.bin\"'</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.profile</span><br>\n```\n\nthen run Hexo using `hexo <command>`\n\n### Required Node.js version\n\nIf you are stuck with older Node.js, you can consider installing a past version of Hexo.\n\nPlease note we do not provide bugfixes to past versions of Hexo.\n\nWe highly recommend to always install the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo?activeTab=versions) of Hexo and the [recommended version](https://hexo.io/docs/#Requirements) of Node.js, whenever possible.\n\n| Hexo version | Minimum (Node.js version) | Less than (Node.js version) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7.0+ | 14.0.0 | latest |\n| 6.2+ | 12.13.0 | latest |\n| 6.0+ | 12.13.0 | 18.5.0 |\n| 5.0+ | 10.13.0 | 12.0.0 |\n| 4.1 - 4.2 | 8.10 | 10.0.0 |\n| 4.0 | 8.6 | 8.10.0 |\n| 3.3 - 3.9 | 6.9 | 8.0.0 |\n| 3.2 - 3.3 | 0.12 | unknown |\n| 3.0 - 3.1 | 0.10 or iojs | unknown |\n| 0.0.1 - 2.8 | 0.10 | unknown |\n(End of copy)\n\n## 2. Build Respository\n\nSelect a folder for your Hexo project. *It is recommended that the path of the folder does not contain characters other than English.* Run these command to initilize Hexo.\n\n```shell\nhexo init <folder>  \ncd <folder>  \nnpm install\n```\n\nTo test the initilization, use:\n```shell\nhexo s\n```\n\nThis will print out something like:\n```\nINFO  Validating config\nINFO  Start processing\nINFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/ . Press Ctrl+C to stop. \n```\n\nAnd the http://localhost:4000/ will look like:\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240715220318.png> \"a\")\n\nIf you see those, it means your initialization is successful.\n\n## 3. Put into use\n\n> `/` or `\\` means the root directory of your Hexo project\n\n### New Post\n\nIf you want to write a new post, type in the terminal:\n```shell\nhexo new post '<post title>'\n# or\nhexo new <scaffolds> '<post title>' # later explained\n```\n\nHexo will create a Markdown file as your post file in the `\\source\\_posts\\<post title>.md`. **Edit this markdown file to modify your blog content.**\n\n#### Front Matter\n\nIn your newly created blog, titled `a`, for example, you will find this at the start of the file:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: '''a'''\ndate: 2024-07-15 22:06:57\ntags:\n---\n```\n\nThis is called **Front Matter** in Hexo, a yaml config header. As you can see, this header contains meta-data of your blog, like the title, date, and tags. The basic idea of yaml is to use a `key: value` to let Hexo get these information. There are also other options which you can find in official document [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter). In this example, I used `categories`. To use multiple value for one key, the format is `key: [value1, value2, etc.]`. In that way, my Front Matter will look like this:\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: '''a'''\ndate: 2024-07-15 22:06:57\ntags: [Anime, Frieren]\ncategories: Thought\n---\n```\n\nAfter this Front Matter, you can write your content happily in Markdown now. However, if I need to add the categories every time I create a post, I will go crazy. To avoid that we should apply Scaffolds.\n\n#### Scaffolds\n\nThis time the official document works, here is a copy:\n\nWhen creating posts, Hexo will build files based on the corresponding file in `scaffolds` folder. For example:\n\n```shell\nhexo new photo \"My Gallery\"\n```\n\nWhen you run this command, Hexo will try to find `photo.md` in the `scaffolds` folder and build the post based on it. \n(End of copy)\n\nFor example, you created `a.md` in `\\scaffolds\\` based on `post.md`:\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: {{ title }}\ndate: {{ date }}\ntags:\ncategories: # this line is added; you can also add default value(s) to it\n---\n```\n\nThen you can type `hexo new a '1'` to create a blog titled '1', with `categories` in the front matter. \n\n#### Modify post\n\nJust edit the markdown file will work.\n\n### Generate your site\n\nVery simple:\n```shell\nhexo g\n```\n\nAll the source files are in the `/public/`. They can be used to deploy on other servers.\n\n## 4. Customization\n\nIf you want to go further by customizing your site, you will need to configure your theme.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\nThe basic meta-data of your blog, like authorship, title, description, etc. is configured in the `/_config.yml`. **Simply follow the comments wrote in the file to add on your information.** Part of my site configuration:\n\n```yml\ntitle: Less is More\nsubtitle: ''\ndescription: ''\nkeywords:\nauthor: HiddenBlue\nlanguage: en\ntimezone: ''\n# URL\n## Set your site url here. For example, if you use GitHub Page, set url as 'https://username.github.io/project'\nurl: http://blog.gu33gu.asia\n```\n\n### Install Themes\n\nExplore your theme here: [Themes | Hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/)\n\nIn this Re blog, I will use `NexT` as example.\n\nFirst, get into its document website: [Getting Started | NexT (theme-next.js.org)](https://theme-next.js.org/docs/getting-started/)\n\nFollow its tutorial to install the theme. *If you encounter any problem, turn down your VPN completely.*\n\n```shell\ncd hexo-site # your project folder\ngit clone https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next themes/next\n```\n\nIn the `/_config.yml`, search for `theme`, and change the its value to `next` (your theme's name):\n```yml\ntheme: next\n```\n\nCopy the content of `/themes/next/_config.yml` to a new file `/_config.next.yml`. If it is other theme, the new file's name should be `_config.<theme name>.yml`.This is the file where you can configure your theme.\n### Configure your Theme\n\nBasically, you just need to follow the comments in the `/_config.next.yaml` to edit the configuration. If you are looking for a specific setting, just search the keyword in the file, and you will locate the related key. For example, you want to enable dark mode. Search for `dark`, you will locate the line:\n```yml\ndarkmode: true # change this to false to disable darkmode\n```\nThere is just a few things that the comment does not state clearly. Here is the explanation for these parts:\n\n#### Customize Menu\n\nIf you want to add your own options under the main menu, add the following code under the `menu` section in `/_config.next.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhome: / || fa fa-home\nabout: /about/ || fa fa-user\nCode: /categories/code/ || fa fa-code\nElucidator: /categories/thought/ || fa fa-pen-nib # newly added\ntags: /tags/ || fa fa-tags # newly added\n```\n\nThis will add two options linking to the category `code` or `thought`. The code after `||` is the name of icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Copy its code similar to the format as the example provided in the `/_config.next.yaml`.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240716230513.png> \"a\")\n\nBy adding these code, my menu became:\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240716230725.png> \"a\")\n\n\n## 5. Deployment\n\n### Host\nThere are several ways to host Hexo pages. There are mainly three ways:\n- Host on GitHub (for free)\n- **Host on an object storage bucket** (cost nearly none)\n- Host on a server (cost)\n\nPersonally, I prefer the second option, as it has much fun. The first option has already lots of tutorials on the Internet, search them yourself.\n\nMost of the object storage platforms, like Google, Tencent, etc., support to host static website on it. I used Tencent, because it is cheap and easy. This bucket costs based on network flowing out of the bucket. 1 GB of network costs \n\nAll the buckets are the same to **setup the bucket**:\n1. When choosing region of the bucket, just not choose area in mainland China, so that you can skip filing ~~which is shit~~ in order to get an SSL certificate. The region should be near your location to guarantee the speed.\n2. set the permissions of all users to be able to view the content of file. Read only!\n3. upload all the files in the `/public/` folder. Make sure the root directory of your bucket does not contain `public` folder, but the content in it(you know what I mean).\n4. see the url of your bucket, then access this url on your browser. You should be able to see your landing page.\n\nAfter modifying your website locally, do the following actions to **update the bucket** remotely:\n1. run `hexo g`\n2. sync local `public` folder and remote root directory\n3. your website is then up-to-date\n\n### Domain (Optional)\n\n#### Register\n\nThere are many popular platforms to register domain, like Google Cloud, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Tencent, etc. The prize varies a lot, and I suggest you can try platform in China, because they are much cheaper. I purchased a domain `gu33gu.asia` for only 6 RMB (0.9 US\\$) for the first year. The regular prize for a year is 30 RMB (4.2 US\\$). That is totally acceptable.\n\n#### Add record\n\nTo let the domain function, you have to add record to trace your bucket's IP. Most bucket platform will provide its own domain, so you just add a `CNAME` record with the value of the provided domain. For example:\n\n```\ntype: CNAME\nname: blog (this part can be whatever you want)\ntarget: (your bucket url)\nTTL: 600 (time(in second) to trace the IP, the smaller value the better)\n```\n\nAfter the record takes effect(usually after the TTL time), you should be able to access through your custom domain. For example, my domain is `gu33gu.asia`, with the record's name `blog`, I am able to access my blog at `blog.gu33gu.asia`.\n\n#### Cloudflare (Optional)\nUsing Cloudflare provides free `SSL` and protection against `ddos attack`(this usually won't happen). In addition, its DNS is free. \n\nRegister an account on Cloudflare, and follow its guidance to add Cloudflare as the DNS server. \n\n#### SSL (Optional)\nOther ways to apply SSL for your domain for free other than Cloudflare, you can try Tencent free certificate. The certificate can endure 3 months. After it expires, you need to register one again. Follow its guidance will do.\n\n## 6. Image Hosting (Optional)\n\nUsually your blogs contain image. **Hexo recommends remote URL**. You can either use a third-party image hosting platform, or **build your own**. I built my own using a object bucket. \n\nCreate a folder on the root directory of your bucket called `_resources`. You should be able to access the content within using direct URL. Upload your pictures to this folder, and format all the URL in your markdown blogs.\n\nTo format them automatically, I wrote a script to help me(`imageFormat.js`):\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// String to replace the root directory of the images\nconst newRootDir = '/new/root/directory';\n\n// Get the directory where the script is located\nconst directoryPath = path.dirname(__filename);\n\n// Function to replace image paths in a single Markdown file\nfunction replaceImagePaths(filePath, newRootDir) {\n    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(`Error reading file ${filePath}:`, err);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Regular expression to match image paths in the format ![[path]]\n        const imgRegex = /!\\[\\[[^\\]]*_resources\\/([^\\]]+)\\]\\]/g;\n        const newData = data.replace(imgRegex, (match, imgPath) => {\n            const fileName = path.basename(imgPath); // Extract the file name\n            const newPath = path.join(newRootDir, fileName); // Construct the new path\n            return `![[${newPath}]]`;\n        });\n\n        fs.writeFile(filePath, newData, 'utf8', err => {\n            if (err) {\n                console.error(`Error writing file ${filePath}:`, err);\n                return;\n            }\n            console.log(`Successfully updated image paths in ${filePath}`);\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// Function to process all Markdown files in a directory\nfunction processDirectory(directoryPath, newRootDir) {\n    fs.readdir(directoryPath, (err, files) => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(`Error reading directory ${directoryPath}:`, err);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        files.forEach(file => {\n            const filePath = path.join(directoryPath, file);\n            if (path.extname(file) === '.md') {\n                replaceImagePaths(filePath, newRootDir);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// Start processing\nprocessDirectory(directoryPath, newRootDir);\n\n```\n\nModify accordingly in reference to the comments, especially the `newRootDir` and `imgRegex`.\n\nPut this script under the directory with your blogs (`_posts` folder), and use `node imageFormat.js` to run it. This will automatically format the image URL of all the markdown files under the same directory.\n\n## 7. END?\n\nI have just built a personal blog, a new body without an interesting soul. To inject soul into this meaningless body to make it of significance, I need to keep adding content into it. **Building a blog is just the beginning. Keep updating it to achieve eminence.**\n\n> 问渠那得清如许？为有源头活水来。 ——朱熹《观书有感》\n\n","source":"_posts/Hexo-Re.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Hexo Re\ndate: 2024-07-17 13:44:19\ntags: [Hexo, re, Website]\ncategories: code\n---\n\n## 0.

Please install Xcode from App Store first. After Xcode is installed, open Xcode and go to **Preferences -> Download -> Command Line Tools -> Install** to install command line tools.\n\n### Install Node.js\n\nNode.js provides [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for most platforms.\n\nAlternative installation methods:\n\n-   Windows: Install it with [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/) (recommended) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n-   Mac: Install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).\n-   Linux (DEB/RPM-based): Install it with [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).\n-   Others: Install it through respective package manager. Refer to [the guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) provided by Node.js.\n\nnvs is also recommended for Mac and Linux to avoid possible permission issue.\n\n> **Windows**\n> \n> If you use the official installer, make sure **Add to PATH** is checked (it’s checked by default).\n\n> **Mac / Linux**\n> \n> If you encounter `EACCES` permission error when trying to install Hexo, please follow [the workaround](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) provided by npmjs; overriding with root/sudo is highly discouraged.\n\n> **Linux**\n> \n> If you installed Node.js using Snap, you may need to manually run `npm install` in the target folder when [initializing](https://hexo.io/docs/commands#init) a blog.\n\n### Install Hexo\n\nOnce all the requirements are installed, you can install Hexo with npm:\n\n```\n<span>$ npm install -g hexo-cli</span><br>\n```\n\n### Advanced installation and usage\n\nAdvanced users may prefer to install and use `hexo` package instead.\n\n```\n<span>$ npm install hexo</span><br>\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can run Hexo in two ways:\n\n1.  `npx hexo <command>`\n2.  Linux users can set relative path of `node_modules/` folder:\n\n```\n<span><span>echo</span> <span>'PATH=\"$PATH:./node_modules/.bin\"'</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.profile</span><br>\n```\n\nthen run Hexo using `hexo <command>`\n\n### Required Node.js version\n\nIf you are stuck with older Node.js, you can consider installing a past version of Hexo.\n\nPlease note we do not provide bugfixes to past versions of Hexo.\n\nWe highly recommend to always install the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo?activeTab=versions) of Hexo and the [recommended version](https://hexo.io/docs/#Requirements) of Node.js, whenever possible.\n\n| Hexo version | Minimum (Node.js version) | Less than (Node.js version) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7.0+ | 14.0.0 | latest |\n| 6.2+ | 12.13.0 | latest |\n| 6.0+ | 12.13.0 | 18.5.0 |\n| 5.0+ | 10.13.0 | 12.0.0 |\n| 4.1 - 4.2 | 8.10 | 10.0.0 |\n| 4.0 | 8.6 | 8.10.0 |\n| 3.3 - 3.9 | 6.9 | 8.0.0 |\n| 3.2 - 3.3 | 0.12 | unknown |\n| 3.0 - 3.1 | 0.10 or iojs | unknown |\n| 0.0.1 - 2.8 | 0.10 | unknown |\n(End of copy)\n\n## 2. Build Respository\n\nSelect a folder for your Hexo project. *It is recommended that the path of the folder does not contain characters other than English.* Run these command to initilize Hexo.\n\n```shell\nhexo init <folder>  \ncd <folder>  \nnpm install\n```\n\nTo test the initilization, use:\n```shell\nhexo s\n```\n\nThis will print out something like:\n```\nINFO  Validating config\nINFO  Start processing\nINFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/ . Press Ctrl+C to stop. \n```\n\nAnd the http://localhost:4000/ will look like:\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240715220318.png> \"a\")\n\nIf you see those, it means your initialization is successful.\n\n## 3. Put into use\n\n> `/` or `\\` means the root directory of your Hexo project\n\n### New Post\n\nIf you want to write a new post, type in the terminal:\n```shell\nhexo new post '<post title>'\n# or\nhexo new <scaffolds> '<post title>' # later explained\n```\n\nHexo will create a Markdown file as your post file in the `\\source\\_posts\\<post title>.md`. **Edit this markdown file to modify your blog content.**\n\n#### Front Matter\n\nIn your newly created blog, titled `a`, for example, you will find this at the start of the file:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: '''a'''\ndate: 2024-07-15 22:06:57\ntags:\n---\n```\n\nThis is called **Front Matter** in Hexo, a yaml config header. As you can see, this header contains meta-data of your blog, like the title, date, and tags. The basic idea of yaml is to use a `key: value` to let Hexo get these information. There are also other options which you can find in official document [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter). In this example, I used `categories`. To use multiple value for one key, the format is `key: [value1, value2, etc.]`. In that way, my Front Matter will look like this:\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: '''a'''\ndate: 2024-07-15 22:06:57\ntags: [Anime, Frieren]\ncategories: Thought\n---\n```\n\nAfter this Front Matter, you can write your content happily in Markdown now. However, if I need to add the categories every time I create a post, I will go crazy. To avoid that we should apply Scaffolds.\n\n#### Scaffolds\n\nThis time the official document works, here is a copy:\n\nWhen creating posts, Hexo will build files based on the corresponding file in `scaffolds` folder. For example:\n\n```shell\nhexo new photo \"My Gallery\"\n```\n\nWhen you run this command, Hexo will try to find `photo.md` in the `scaffolds` folder and build the post based on it. \n(End of copy)\n\nFor example, you created `a.md` in `\\scaffolds\\` based on `post.md`:\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: {{ title }}\ndate: {{ date }}\ntags:\ncategories: # this line is added; you can also add default value(s) to it\n---\n```\n\nThen you can type `hexo new a '1'` to create a blog titled '1', with `categories` in the front matter. \n\n#### Modify post\n\nJust edit the markdown file will work.\n\n### Generate your site\n\nVery simple:\n```shell\nhexo g\n```\n\nAll the source files are in the `/public/`. They can be used to deploy on other servers.\n\n## 4. Customization\n\nIf you want to go further by customizing your site, you will need to configure your theme.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\nThe basic meta-data of your blog, like authorship, title, description, etc. is configured in the `/_config.yml`. **Simply follow the comments wrote in the file to add on your information.** Part of my site configuration:\n\n```yml\ntitle: Less is More\nsubtitle: ''\ndescription: ''\nkeywords:\nauthor: HiddenBlue\nlanguage: en\ntimezone: ''\n# URL\n## Set your site url here. For example, if you use GitHub Page, set url as 'https://username.github.io/project'\nurl: http://blog.gu33gu.asia\n```\n\n### Install Themes\n\nExplore your theme here: [Themes | Hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/)\n\nIn this Re blog, I will use `NexT` as example.\n\nFirst, get into its document website: [Getting Started | NexT (theme-next.js.org)](https://theme-next.js.org/docs/getting-started/)\n\nFollow its tutorial to install the theme. *If you encounter any problem, turn down your VPN completely.*\n\n```shell\ncd hexo-site # your project folder\ngit clone https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next themes/next\n```\n\nIn the `/_config.yml`, search for `theme`, and change the its value to `next` (your theme's name):\n```yml\ntheme: next\n```\n\nCopy the content of `/themes/next/_config.yml` to a new file `/_config.next.yml`. If it is other theme, the new file's name should be `_config.<theme name>.yml`.This is the file where you can configure your theme.\n### Configure your Theme\n\nBasically, you just need to follow the comments in the `/_config.next.yaml` to edit the configuration. If you are looking for a specific setting, just search the keyword in the file, and you will locate the related key. For example, you want to enable dark mode. Search for `dark`, you will locate the line:\n```yml\ndarkmode: true # change this to false to disable darkmode\n```\nThere is just a few things that the comment does not state clearly. Here is the explanation for these parts:\n\n#### Customize Menu\n\nIf you want to add your own options under the main menu, add the following code under the `menu` section in `/_config.next.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhome: / || fa fa-home\nabout: /about/ || fa fa-user\nCode: /categories/code/ || fa fa-code\nElucidator: /categories/thought/ || fa fa-pen-nib # newly added\ntags: /tags/ || fa fa-tags # newly added\n```\n\nThis will add two options linking to the category `code` or `thought`. The code after `||` is the name of icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Copy its code similar to the format as the example provided in the `/_config.next.yaml`.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240716230513.png> \"a\")\n\nBy adding these code, my menu became:\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240716230725.png> \"a\")\n\n\n## 5. Deployment\n\n### Host\nThere are several ways to host Hexo pages. There are mainly three ways:\n- Host on GitHub (for free)\n- **Host on an object storage bucket** (cost nearly none)\n- Host on a server (cost)\n\nPersonally, I prefer the second option, as it has much fun. The first option has already lots of tutorials on the Internet, search them yourself.\n\nMost of the object storage platforms, like Google, Tencent, etc., support to host static website on it. I used Tencent, because it is cheap and easy. This bucket costs based on network flowing out of the bucket. 1 GB of network costs \n\nAll the buckets are the same to **setup the bucket**:\n1. When choosing region of the bucket, just not choose area in mainland China, so that you can skip filing ~~which is shit~~ in order to get an SSL certificate. The region should be near your location to guarantee the speed.\n2. set the permissions of all users to be able to view the content of file. Read only!\n3. upload all the files in the `/public/` folder. Make sure the root directory of your bucket does not contain `public` folder, but the content in it(you know what I mean).\n4. see the url of your bucket, then access this url on your browser. You should be able to see your landing page.\n\nAfter modifying your website locally, do the following actions to **update the bucket** remotely:\n1. run `hexo g`\n2. sync local `public` folder and remote root directory\n3. your website is then up-to-date\n\n### Domain (Optional)\n\n#### Register\n\nThere are many popular platforms to register domain, like Google Cloud, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Tencent, etc. The prize varies a lot, and I suggest you can try platform in China, because they are much cheaper. I purchased a domain `gu33gu.asia` for only 6 RMB (0.9 US\\$) for the first year. The regular prize for a year is 30 RMB (4.2 US\\$). That is totally acceptable.\n\n#### Add record\n\nTo let the domain function, you have to add record to trace your bucket's IP. Most bucket platform will provide its own domain, so you just add a `CNAME` record with the value of the provided domain. For example:\n\n```\ntype: CNAME\nname: blog (this part can be whatever you want)\ntarget: (your bucket url)\nTTL: 600 (time(in second) to trace the IP, the smaller value the better)\n```\n\nAfter the record takes effect(usually after the TTL time), you should be able to access through your custom domain. For example, my domain is `gu33gu.asia`, with the record's name `blog`, I am able to access my blog at `blog.gu33gu.asia`.\n\n#### Cloudflare (Optional)\nUsing Cloudflare provides free `SSL` and protection against `ddos attack`(this usually won't happen). In addition, its DNS is free. \n\nRegister an account on Cloudflare, and follow its guidance to add Cloudflare as the DNS server. \n\n#### SSL (Optional)\nOther ways to apply SSL for your domain for free other than Cloudflare, you can try Tencent free certificate. The certificate can endure 3 months. After it expires, you need to register one again. Follow its guidance will do.\n\n## 6. Image Hosting (Optional)\n\nUsually your blogs contain image. **Hexo recommends remote URL**. You can either use a third-party image hosting platform, or **build your own**. I built my own using a object bucket. \n\nCreate a folder on the root directory of your bucket called `_resources`. You should be able to access the content within using direct URL. Upload your pictures to this folder, and format all the URL in your markdown blogs.\n\nTo format them automatically, I wrote a script to help me(`imageFormat.js`):\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// String to replace the root directory of the images\nconst newRootDir = '/new/root/directory';\n\n// Get the directory where the script is located\nconst directoryPath = path.dirname(__filename);\n\n// Function to replace image paths in a single Markdown file\nfunction replaceImagePaths(filePath, newRootDir) {\n    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(`Error reading file ${filePath}:`, err);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Regular expression to match image paths in the format ![[path]]\n        const imgRegex = /!\\[\\[[^\\]]*_resources\\/([^\\]]+)\\]\\]/g;\n        const newData = data.replace(imgRegex, (match, imgPath) => {\n            const fileName = path.basename(imgPath); // Extract the file name\n            const newPath = path.join(newRootDir, fileName); // Construct the new path\n            return `![[${newPath}]]`;\n        });\n\n        fs.writeFile(filePath, newData, 'utf8', err => {\n            if (err) {\n                console.error(`Error writing file ${filePath}:`, err);\n                return;\n            }\n            console.log(`Successfully updated image paths in ${filePath}`);\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// Function to process all Markdown files in a directory\nfunction processDirectory(directoryPath, newRootDir) {\n    fs.readdir(directoryPath, (err, files) => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(`Error reading directory ${directoryPath}:`, err);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        files.forEach(file => {\n            const filePath = path.join(directoryPath, file);\n            if (path.extname(file) === '.md') {\n                replaceImagePaths(filePath, newRootDir);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// Start processing\nprocessDirectory(directoryPath, newRootDir);\n\n```\n\nModify accordingly in reference to the comments, especially the `newRootDir` and `imgRegex`.\n\nPut this script under the directory with your blogs (`_posts` folder), and use `node imageFormat.js` to run it. This will automatically format the image URL of all the markdown files under the same directory.\n\n## 7. END?\n\nI have just built a personal blog, a new body without an interesting soul. To inject soul into this meaningless body to make it of significance, I need to keep adding content into it. **Building a blog is just the beginning. Keep updating it to achieve eminence.**\n\n> 问渠那得清如许？为有源头活水来。 ——朱熹《观书有感》\n\n","slug":"Hexo-Re","published":1,"updated":"2025-03-22T02:51:25.380Z","_id":"cm73i44yn001islij5fx437dv","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"content":"<h2 id=\"0-Intro\"><a href=\"#0-Intro\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"0.

The requirements of the blogger platform are: easy maintenance(including deployment and easy fee), and allowing custom configurations(themes, domain, font, etc.). In order to meet these requirements <del>as well as to be cool</del>, I finally chose Hexo, a .js based static website generator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-Hexo\"><a href=\"#why-Hexo\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"why Hexo\"></a>why Hexo</h3><p>About the website, I first thought of flasks, as it can do most of the job if you code it properly. However, coding stuffs is time consuming when it comes to make something elegant from scratch. Although there was a good and open-source one on GitHub called <a href=\"https://github.com/xpleaf/Blog_mini\">Blog_mini</a>, I still forsaked the plan, as I just don’t prefer to do <strong>too much programming</strong> this time, even I merely need to make modification on finished product. In addition, since the website using flask will be based on a database. When it comes to deployment, it will <strong>cost</strong> a bit. In that way, I dropped my plan about dynamic ones<del>, although it would be a perfect opportunity to show off</del>.</p>\n<p>The only option for me, then, is <strong>static website</strong>. I would definitely NOT code one from scratch, so I needed to choose a pre-built tool to help me generate one. Compared to other pre-built generators, Hexo has a <strong>good community eco-system</strong>, making its customization effective. Alongside its <strong>aptness to deploy</strong> and intergation with git for version control, this becomes an ideal tool to keep my blogs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Environment\"><a href=\"#1-Environment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

As you can see, this header contains meta-data of your blog, like the title, date, and tags. The basic idea of yaml is to use a <code>key: value</code> to let Hexo get these information. There are also other options which you can find in official document <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter\">Front-matter</a>. In this example, I used <code>categories</code>. To use multiple value for one key, the format is <code>key: [value1, value2, etc.]</code>. In that way, my Front Matter will look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">---</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">title:</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span><span class=\"string\">&#x27;a&#x27;</span><span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">date:</span> <span class=\"number\">2024-07-15 22:06:57</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">tags:</span> [<span class=\"string\">Anime</span>, <span class=\"string\">Frieren</span>]</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">categories:</span> <span class=\"string\">Thought</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">---</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>After this Front Matter, you can write your content happily in Markdown now. However, if I need to add the categories every time I create a post, I will go crazy.

There are mainly three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host on GitHub (for free)</li>\n<li><strong>Host on an object storage bucket</strong> (cost nearly none)</li>\n<li>Host on a server (cost)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I prefer the second option, as it has much fun. The first option has already lots of tutorials on the Internet, search them yourself.</p>\n<p>Most of the object storage platforms, like Google, Tencent, etc., support to host static website on it. I used Tencent, because it is cheap and easy. This bucket costs based on network flowing out of the bucket. 1 GB of network costs </p>\n<p>All the buckets are the same to <strong>setup the bucket</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When choosing region of the bucket, just not choose area in mainland China, so that you can skip filing <del>which is shit</del> in order to get an SSL certificate. The region should be near your location to guarantee the speed.</li>\n<li>set the permissions of all users to be able to view the content of file. Read only!</li>\n<li>upload all the files in the <code>/public/</code> folder. Make sure the root directory of your bucket does not contain <code>public</code> folder, but the content in it(you know what I mean).</li>\n<li>see the url of your bucket, then access this url on your browser. You should be able to see your landing page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After modifying your website locally, do the following actions to <strong>update the bucket</strong> remotely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>run <code>hexo g</code></li>\n<li>sync local <code>public</code> folder and remote root directory</li>\n<li>your website is then up-to-date</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Domain-Optional\"><a href=\"#Domain-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Domain (Optional)\"></a>Domain (Optional)</h3><h4 id=\"Register\"><a href=\"#Register\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Register\"></a>Register</h4><p>There are many popular platforms to register domain, like Google Cloud, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Tencent, etc. The prize varies a lot, and I suggest you can try platform in China, because they are much cheaper. I purchased a domain <code>gu33gu.asia</code> for only 6 RMB (0.9 US$) for the first year. The regular prize for a year is 30 RMB (4.2 US$). That is totally acceptable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Add-record\"><a href=\"#Add-record\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Add record\"></a>Add record</h4><p>To let the domain function, you have to add record to trace your bucket’s IP. Most bucket platform will provide its own domain, so you just add a <code>CNAME</code> record with the value of the provided domain. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">type: CNAME</span><br><span class=\"line\">name: blog (this part can be whatever you want)</span><br><span class=\"line\">target: (your bucket url)</span><br><span class=\"line\">TTL: 600 (time(in second) to trace the IP, the smaller value the better)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>After the record takes effect(usually after the TTL time), you should be able to access through your custom domain. For example, my domain is <code>gu33gu.asia</code>, with the record’s name <code>blog</code>, I am able to access my blog at <code>blog.gu33gu.asia</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cloudflare-Optional\"><a href=\"#Cloudflare-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cloudflare (Optional)\"></a>Cloudflare (Optional)</h4><p>Using Cloudflare provides free <code>SSL</code> and protection against <code>ddos attack</code>(this usually won’t happen). In addition, its DNS is free. </p>\n<p>Register an account on Cloudflare, and follow its guidance to add Cloudflare as the DNS server. </p>\n<h4 id=\"SSL-Optional\"><a href=\"#SSL-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SSL (Optional)\"></a>SSL (Optional)</h4><p>Other ways to apply SSL for your domain for free other than Cloudflare, you can try Tencent free certificate. The certificate can endure 3 months. After it expires, you need to register one again. Follow its guidance will do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-Image-Hosting-Optional\"><a href=\"#6-Image-Hosting-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"6. Image Hosting (Optional)\"></a>6. Image Hosting (Optional)</h2><p>Usually your blogs contain image. <strong>Hexo recommends remote URL</strong>.

END?</h2><p>I have just built a personal blog, a new body without an interesting soul. To inject soul into this meaningless body to make it of significance, I need to keep adding content into it. <strong>Building a blog is just the beginning. Keep updating it to achieve eminence.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>问渠那得清如许？为有源头活水来。 ——朱熹《观书有感》</p>\n</blockquote>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<h2 id=\"0-Intro\"><a href=\"#0-Intro\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"0. Intro\"></a>0. Intro</h2><p>For some reasons(see the blog yourself), I wanted to <strong>start my personal blog</strong>. The requirements of the blogger platform are: easy maintenance(including deployment and easy fee), and allowing custom configurations(themes, domain, font, etc.). In order to meet these requirements <del>as well as to be cool</del>, I finally chose Hexo, a .js based static website generator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-Hexo\"><a href=\"#why-Hexo\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"why Hexo\"></a>why Hexo</h3><p>About the website, I first thought of flasks, as it can do most of the job if you code it properly. However, coding stuffs is time consuming when it comes to make something elegant from scratch. Although there was a good and open-source one on GitHub called <a href=\"https://github.com/xpleaf/Blog_mini\">Blog_mini</a>, I still forsaked the plan, as I just don’t prefer to do <strong>too much programming</strong> this time, even I merely need to make modification on finished product. In addition, since the website using flask will be based on a database. When it comes to deployment, it will <strong>cost</strong> a bit. In that way, I dropped my plan about dynamic ones<del>, although it would be a perfect opportunity to show off</del>.</p>\n<p>The only option for me, then, is <strong>static website</strong>. I would definitely NOT code one from scratch, so I needed to choose a pre-built tool to help me generate one. Compared to other pre-built generators, Hexo has a <strong>good community eco-system</strong>, making its customization effective. Alongside its <strong>aptness to deploy</strong> and intergation with git for version control, this becomes an ideal tool to keep my blogs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Environment\"><a href=\"#1-Environment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

As you can see, this header contains meta-data of your blog, like the title, date, and tags. The basic idea of yaml is to use a <code>key: value</code> to let Hexo get these information. There are also other options which you can find in official document <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter\">Front-matter</a>. In this example, I used <code>categories</code>. To use multiple value for one key, the format is <code>key: [value1, value2, etc.]</code>. In that way, my Front Matter will look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">---</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">title:</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span><span class=\"string\">&#x27;a&#x27;</span><span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">date:</span> <span class=\"number\">2024-07-15 22:06:57</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">tags:</span> [<span class=\"string\">Anime</span>, <span class=\"string\">Frieren</span>]</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">categories:</span> <span class=\"string\">Thought</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">---</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>After this Front Matter, you can write your content happily in Markdown now.

There are mainly three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host on GitHub (for free)</li>\n<li><strong>Host on an object storage bucket</strong> (cost nearly none)</li>\n<li>Host on a server (cost)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I prefer the second option, as it has much fun. The first option has already lots of tutorials on the Internet, search them yourself.</p>\n<p>Most of the object storage platforms, like Google, Tencent, etc., support to host static website on it. I used Tencent, because it is cheap and easy. This bucket costs based on network flowing out of the bucket. 1 GB of network costs </p>\n<p>All the buckets are the same to <strong>setup the bucket</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When choosing region of the bucket, just not choose area in mainland China, so that you can skip filing <del>which is shit</del> in order to get an SSL certificate. The region should be near your location to guarantee the speed.</li>\n<li>set the permissions of all users to be able to view the content of file. Read only!</li>\n<li>upload all the files in the <code>/public/</code> folder. Make sure the root directory of your bucket does not contain <code>public</code> folder, but the content in it(you know what I mean).</li>\n<li>see the url of your bucket, then access this url on your browser. You should be able to see your landing page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After modifying your website locally, do the following actions to <strong>update the bucket</strong> remotely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>run <code>hexo g</code></li>\n<li>sync local <code>public</code> folder and remote root directory</li>\n<li>your website is then up-to-date</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Domain-Optional\"><a href=\"#Domain-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Domain (Optional)\"></a>Domain (Optional)</h3><h4 id=\"Register\"><a href=\"#Register\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Register\"></a>Register</h4><p>There are many popular platforms to register domain, like Google Cloud, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Tencent, etc. The prize varies a lot, and I suggest you can try platform in China, because they are much cheaper. I purchased a domain <code>gu33gu.asia</code> for only 6 RMB (0.9 US$) for the first year. The regular prize for a year is 30 RMB (4.2 US$). That is totally acceptable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Add-record\"><a href=\"#Add-record\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Add record\"></a>Add record</h4><p>To let the domain function, you have to add record to trace your bucket’s IP. Most bucket platform will provide its own domain, so you just add a <code>CNAME</code> record with the value of the provided domain. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">type: CNAME</span><br><span class=\"line\">name: blog (this part can be whatever you want)</span><br><span class=\"line\">target: (your bucket url)</span><br><span class=\"line\">TTL: 600 (time(in second) to trace the IP, the smaller value the better)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>After the record takes effect(usually after the TTL time), you should be able to access through your custom domain. For example, my domain is <code>gu33gu.asia</code>, with the record’s name <code>blog</code>, I am able to access my blog at <code>blog.gu33gu.asia</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cloudflare-Optional\"><a href=\"#Cloudflare-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cloudflare (Optional)\"></a>Cloudflare (Optional)</h4><p>Using Cloudflare provides free <code>SSL</code> and protection against <code>ddos attack</code>(this usually won’t happen). In addition, its DNS is free. </p>\n<p>Register an account on Cloudflare, and follow its guidance to add Cloudflare as the DNS server. </p>\n<h4 id=\"SSL-Optional\"><a href=\"#SSL-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SSL (Optional)\"></a>SSL (Optional)</h4><p>Other ways to apply SSL for your domain for free other than Cloudflare, you can try Tencent free certificate. The certificate can endure 3 months. After it expires, you need to register one again. Follow its guidance will do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-Image-Hosting-Optional\"><a href=\"#6-Image-Hosting-Optional\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"6. Image Hosting (Optional)\"></a>6.

You can either use a third-party image hosting platform, or <strong>build your own</strong>. I built my own using a object bucket. </p>\n<p>Create a folder on the root directory of your bucket called <code>_resources</code>. You should be able to access the content within using direct URL. Upload your pictures to this folder, and format all the URL in your markdown blogs.</p>\n<p>To format them automatically, I wrote a script to help me(<code>imageFormat.js</code>):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br><span class=\"line\">33</span><br><span class=\"line\">34</span><br><span class=\"line\">35</span><br><span class=\"line\">36</span><br><span class=\"line\">37</span><br><span class=\"line\">38</span><br><span class=\"line\">39</span><br><span class=\"line\">40</span><br><span class=\"line\">41</span><br><span class=\"line\">42</span><br><span class=\"line\">43</span><br><span class=\"line\">44</span><br><span class=\"line\">45</span><br><span class=\"line\">46</span><br><span class=\"line\">47</span><br><span class=\"line\">48</span><br><span class=\"line\">49</span><br><span class=\"line\">50</span><br><span class=\"line\">51</span><br><span class=\"line\">52</span><br><span class=\"line\">53</span><br><span class=\"line\">54</span><br><span class=\"line\">55</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> fs = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">&#x27;fs&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> path = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">&#x27;path&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// String to replace the root directory of the images</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> newRootDir = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;/new/root/directory&#x27;</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Get the directory where the script is located</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> directoryPath = path.<span class=\"title function_\">dirname</span>(__filename);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Function to replace image paths in a single Markdown file</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title function_\">replaceImagePaths</span>(<span class=\"params\">filePath, newRootDir</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    fs.<span class=\"title function_\">readFile</span>(filePath, <span class=\"string\">&#x27;utf8&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">err, data</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (err) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            <span class=\"variable language_\">console</span>.<span class=\"title function_\">error</span>(<span class=\"string\">`Error reading file <span class=\"subst\">$&#123;filePath&#125;</span>:`</span>, err);</span><br><span class=\"line\">            <span class=\"keyword\">return</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"comment\">// Regular expression to match image paths in the format ![[path]]</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> imgRegex = <span class=\"regexp\">/!\\[\\[[^\\]]*_resources\\/([^\\]]+)\\]\\]/g</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> newData = data.<span class=\"title function_\">replace</span>(imgRegex, <span class=\"function\">(<span class=\"params\">match, imgPath</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            <span class=\"keyword\">const</span> fileName = path.<span class=\"title function_\">basename</span>(imgPath);

We **lack of a easy tool** to administrate as well as **a platform to show these data** to the public. Webird is born to fill these gaps.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240729212201.png> \"a\")\n\nWe lack of tools that is easy to use to manage the data, birding records of considerable quantity. Our school has a variety of bird species, *79 different species had been spotted* until 2024. In addition, the population of the birds is also stunning. On the March 20th in 2024, for example, we observed a swarm of around fourty Pied Avocet; the population of the coots also took the land around the internal lake every winter. Usually, we use excel to manage these data, which is stable, but requires additional effort to learn how to operate with it. Since most of our members are not computer science students, it would be too difficult for them to manage the data using excel.\n\nWe also lack of a platform to show people the data. When cooperating with the Campus Operation on the theme of 'Keeping the Weeds', we failed to persuade them to preserve the weeds permanentaly. One factor is that we did not present the data to intuitively show the effect of keeping weeds, because Excel lacks of flexibility and 'visualibility'. Not only the faculty, but also the students, are not aware of the biodiversity on our campus. During the Bird Conservation Week, participants seldom recognize the bird species, nor having a rough idea of why we are protecting them. As an amateur developer, the first step for the Bird Conservation Zhixing to raise the related awareness is to *make our data public*, and then to *make the data presents itself* to our community to tell the whole story of birds on campus.\n\n## Similar Product\n\n> These products are mature and powerful, but not useful for a small region like our campus.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240725114045.png> \"a\")\n\nThe most famous application to keep record and share these data is Ebird, developed by Cornell Lab. \n\n> Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education. At the same time, we develop tools that make birding more rewarding. From being able to manage lists, photos and audio recordings, to seeing real-time maps of species distribution, to alerts that let you know when species have been seen, we strive to provide the most current and useful information to the birding community. - Ebird About page\n\nIt is one of the world's largest biodiversity-related science projects, started from long time ago, so it is quite a mature tool.\n\nHowever, when using this tool to manage the records myself, I found that *Ebird does not work well on a tiny region* like our campus. Although it supports location based on latitude and langtitude, the decimals are not accurate enough to distinguish the sub-places on campus. Thus, it cannot show the overall distribution of birds on campus. Furthermore, Ebird does not support recording for bird strike on windows. These all make Ebird disqualified for the job in our Zhixing.\n\n# History of Webird\n\n## Initial Plan\nFeatures:\n - A beautiful map to show birds distribution over space;\n - Record management(add/delete/filtering/edit), distinguishing normal records and strikes;\n - Species management(connected with record);\n - Gallery to show images(Optional)\n\nI had never made a great project like this myself, so I did not take time to design the detail.

Powered by Python.' This tool's original aim is to help you build a content-oriented blog website, but the simplicity draws my attention. With just a line of command, I can generate the whole static website. I soon started to work using this tool.\n\nSince this is a static website generator and one of my aim was to create a dynamic one, *I thought of a way to make it dynamic without knowing anything about database*. As I learnt how to operate with Excel using Python in the past, I created a script with several functions to use Excel as a database, not aware of myself building a database. I created several sheets as different table to store data: \n- Records(id, species unique name, quantity, time, location unique name)\n- Species(id, species unique name, description, translated name)\n\nA script was created to allow adding record data. The user just needs to write a markdown file as a post with the category `record` and current date, and after that with record data like the following format:\n```yaml\nLittleEgret: 3\nCoot: 2\nUnknown: 2\n```\n\nWhen generating the website, a script will automatically sync the data in these markdown posts with the Excel file, and use these aggregate functions I wrote to get the location and species' sum, average and median. To make a beautiful map, I created a post with the date 2077, so that it always stays on top, with an HTML code illustrating the map with markers embedded in it.\n\nAlthough this tool achieves all the goals I set, this is still not ideal. The biggest issue is that this system lacks of an easy way for members to add records. Adding records without a GUI is completely unacceptable for any member of the Bird Conservation Zhixing. Thus, I headed another way.\n\n## Dynamic Website from Scratch (Django)\n\n> Meet the requirement, easy to maintain or add new function, but takes time to learn how to master it (still not quite a master of it).\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240725104937.png> \"a\")\n\nI took time to learn how to operate with database(SQL) and Django through Bilibili(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ) for at least a month, and with the assistance from ChatGPT. Finally, I settled down using Django. I first followed the course on Bilibili, but did not finish the course, as I thought it was just teaching some excessive detail that is not quite useful. When I encounter some questions, I would *ask ChatGPT*, and use its answer to look on web to figure out the concept. I settled down on this method.\n\n# Current Version\n\n## Overall Structure\n\n> Disjointed structure of main program and image hosting to allow better traffic experience.\n\nI divide the system into two parts: one is the *main program* which operates with the record database, and the other one for *image hosting*. They could be built on the same server, but by doing so will allow more flexibility, if I want to build a faster image hosting platform or use a third-party one.\n\n## Main App(Webird)\n\n### Databases\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240729221852.png> \"a\")\n\nTable `webird_records` **serves the main function of records management** and uses the `webird_birdinfo` to indicate its species and `webird_location` to show its location. The table `webird_birdclasses` categorizes the species in the table `webird_birdinfo`. \n\nTable `webird_img` is for the gallery function (**management of images**). Since a picture can sometimes depict at least two kinds of birds, `webird_img_species` table is developed to store the 'many-to-many' relationship between the `webird_img` and `webird_info`. It also uses a foreign key with the table `webird_location` to indicate picture's location. \n\nThe naming of these tables and fields still need to be improved, as they are hard to remember and quite easy to cause obfuscation.\n\nThe following are some important notes on fields in some tables.\n#### `webird_records`\n\nIn the table `webird_records`, the field `rtype` is for distinguishing the type of record(bird death or normal record).\n\n#### `webird_img`\n\nIn table `webird_img`, field `src` is for the compressed image's url, while the field `ori_src` is for the url of the image with original size.\n\n#### `webird_location`\n\n`display` controls whether the place is displayed as a marker on the data page. For example, the place `unknown` cannot be seen as a marker on the distribution map at url `/`. (see yourself)\n\n### Main Functions\n#### Core Function: `record_query`\n\n> Basically, the function `record_query` is to construct a SQL according to the input dictionary(filtering constrains entered by user).\n\nSince some fields are allowed to be left blank, and the logic of filtering can be complicated(have both `AND` and `OR` logics), manually construct a `Q` query is neccesary. In addition, there are three functions need the same filter mechanism, a function was created to make code neat.\n\nThe code first go over these fields, construct sub `Q` filters, and finally add them together using the logic `AND`. Most of the fields only requires detection if it is empty, but a special case is the field `bird_class_ids`. In this field, the bird classes are transformed into a list of bird species respectively, which are then added into the sub filter `bird_filter`.\n\nWhen using the code, the filter form filled by user is converted into a dictionary. Then a dictionary is passed into the function as a param to return the result of filter.\n\npart of the code:\n```python\ndef record_query(q_dic):\n    bird_filter = None\n    if 'species' in q_dic:\n        species_ids = q_dic['species']\n        for species_id in species_ids:\n            if bird_filter:\n                bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id)) | bird_filter\n            else:\n                bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id))\n    elif 'bird_class_ids' in q_dic:\n        classes_ids = q_dic['bird_class_ids']\n        for classes_id in classes_ids:\n            classes_id = int(classes_id)\n            bird_class = BirdClasses.objects.get(id=classes_id)\n            birds = bird_class.birdinfo_set.all()\n            for bird in birds:\n                species_id = bird.id\n                if bird_filter:\n                    bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id)) | bird_filter\n                else:\n                    bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id))\n\n    # Other sub-filters\n\t# Add them all together using AND\n    api_filter = Q(date__range=time_interval)\n    if bird_filter:\n        api_filter = bird_filter & api_filter\n    if location_filter:\n        api_filter = location_filter & api_filter\n    if type_filter:\n        api_filter = type_filter & api_filter\n\n    return Records.objects.all().filter(api_filter).distinct()\n```\n\n#### Data Page (`/`) `show_data`\n\n> This page(view function) is responsible for showing the overall data(the distribution map, charts) and recieve user's filter form to fill out the data.\n\nIt first takes in the form. \n\nIf the form is valid, function `record_query` is called to filter the data according to the filter form. Then the filtered data is passed to render the `show_data.html`.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240726101923.png> \"a\")\n\nOtherwise, it will render the `show_data_initial.html` with the overall data. First, locations are obtained from the database, and for each location, aggregate functions are called to get the life and death data. Then `the total live and death observed` is calculated again through aggregate functions.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240725104937.png> \"a\")\n\n#### Download data in Json or CSV `record_api` and `record_get_csv`\n\n##### Json `record_api`\nAfter the data is filtered, there will be a button `Json` to allow export the data in the format of Json. \n\n```python\ndef record_api(request):\n    q_dic = convert_querydict2dict(request.GET)\n    record_result = models.record_query(q_dic)\n    json_data = RecordsSerializer(record_result, many=True).data\n    return JsonResponse(json_data, safe=False)\n```\n\nTo make the data in Json, a **serializer** is added.\n\n##### CSV `record_get_csv`\n\nData is obtained through `record_query`, and response type was specified. Then use the `writer` instance to write in the data rows.\n```python\nresponse = HttpResponse(content_type='text/csv')\nresponse['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; \n\tfilename=\"data.csv\"'\nresponse.write(codecs.BOM_UTF8)\nwriter = csv.writer(response)\n```\n\n#### location, species, classes pages `location_view` and `species_view` and `classes_view`\n\nAlthough their content are different, they have nearly the same code structure. First, the aggregated data is obtained from the database, and they are passed to the rendering. Additionally, to allow administrators to modify the content, the function also takes `POST` requests from authenticated users to get the updated content, like `name`, `description`, etc.\n\n#### Other functions\n\nJust use the basic filter to filter out the data accordingly, then render the data on the webpage. I ~~am just lazy~~ think it is too simple to explain.\n\n## Image Hosting App (Pic)\n\n### Database\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240726104056.png> \"a\")\n\nOnly one table. `Ori_img` is the original image's path in the storage, while `sml_img` is for the compressed images' path. `uploaded_at` is the date when uploaded.\n\n### Core Function: Upload and Manage Portal\n\nIt is just a simple example how an image was uploaded and displayed.\n\n```python\ndef receive_img(request):\n    form = ImageForm(request.POST, request.FILES)\n    if form.is_valid():\n        result = form.save()\n        return render(request, 'copy_redirect.html', {'link': result.link})\n    print(\"not valid image\")\n    return redirect('/img/add/')\n\ndef image_list(request):\n    images = Img.objects.all()\n    return render(request, 'image_list.html', {'images': images, })\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n> Initial on Tencent Lighthouse and Vercel, but the deployment was complicated, so I changed to Google Cloud Run.\n\nI hate deployment, since it always requires me to do configuration stuffs which are annoying. However, to make my application online, I have to do it.\n\n### Host Python things\n\n> Hosting a Python website is suffering. Finally, I host it on Google Cloud Run.\n\nI first managed to deploy my code on a raw server in Tencent Cloud. I managed to configure the Nginx, but failed, despite the fact that I studied the tutorials on the Internet for hours. I then found vercel, but the configuration file was just too complicated, and ChatGPT could not help me. **I finally turned to Google Cloud Run**, which has an example project which is quite simple. It just has an additional `proc` file and a `docker` configuration for me to complete. With little modification, my application successfully got online.\n\n### Bucket\n\nSince my application has media and static files, storing them in the Docker is unacceptable. I used Google's bucket to host both my media and static files. This is again an annoying task,  since the configuration was still a bit complex.\n\nFirst, you will need `django-storages[google]` and `gcsUtils` in your Python Environment. Then add in the `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nSTORAGES = {\n    \"default\": {\n        \"BACKEND\": \"storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage\",\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"location\": \"media/\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"staticfiles\": {\n        \"BACKEND\": \"storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage\",\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"location\": \"static2/\",\n        },\n    },\n}\n\nGS_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('GS_BUCKET_NAME')\nGS_PROJECT_ID = os.getenv('GS_PROJECT_ID')\nGS_DEFAULT_ACL = os.getenv('GS_DEFAULT_ACL')\n\nGS_FILE_OVERWRITE = False\n\nGS_CREDENTIALS = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'gcpCredentials.json'),\n)\n\nBUCKET_URL = os.getenv('BUCKET_URL')\n\nSTATIC_URL = os.path.join(BUCKET_URL, 'static2/')\nSTATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static2')\n\nMEDIA_URL = os.path.join(BUCKET_URL, 'media/')\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')\n```\n\nSince it's in production, these variables are loaded from the environment(I recommend you to do so). `GS_CREDENTIALS` should be loaded from the `Secret`, but the configuration was rather complex~~(lazy)~~. So, instead, I loaded it from a credential file.\n\nCreate a new file `gcsUtils.py` in the same directory with `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom storages.backends.gcloud import GoogleCloudStorage\n\nStatic = lambda: GoogleCloudStorage(location='static')\nMedia = lambda: GoogleCloudStorage(location='media')\n```\n\nAlthough there are just a few lines of modification, it takes me a week to figure them out. Crazy.\n\n### Database\n\nIf you want to get a database directly, the cost is significant. To save some money, I chose the lighthouse server on Tencent, and installed the MySQL myself. The server has 2 kernel and 2GB RAM, cost only 45 RMB per month.\n\n### Cloudflare(optional)\n\nI used Cloudflare as my DNS server to reduce bots' requests, to save some network fee.\n\n# Future\n\nThere are always things to improve. For example, since the google cloud run costs, it would still better to run my code on a lighthouse server, using the Baota([宝塔面板 (bt.cn)](https://www.bt.cn/new/index.html)). Also, the **readability** of my code should be better. Variables' name and annotation should be less ambiguous and 'random'. There are also **safety concern**, like the image host lack of mechanism to prevent inline linking. There are also lots of other things... ...\n\nApart from technical improvement, this project lack of social construction, since this project is built by myself alone. I am also looking for contributers to help me maintain and update this project(maybe).\n\n# Personal Reflection\n\n**It was such a rewarding journey.** I learnt almost every process of making a working dynamic website by myself, surprisingly for the first time. It was just a dream when I decided to make this project, and I was not certain I could finish it some day. However, I did it, thanks to my dedication and generative AI which empowered my learning speed.\n\n> _“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”_ — Shoyo Hinata \"Haikyuu!!\"\n","source":"_posts/How-I-built-Webird.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How I built Webird\ndate: 2024-07-29 21:54:53\ntags: [website, re, Python, bird, recommended]\ncategories: code\n---\n\n# Current Situation\n\n> Birding data management and interpretation are two gaps that need to be filled in our Zhixing. We **lack of a easy tool** to administrate as well as **a platform to show these data** to the public. Webird is born to fill these gaps.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240729212201.png> \"a\")\n\nWe lack of tools that is easy to use to manage the data, birding records of considerable quantity. Our school has a variety of bird species, *79 different species had been spotted* until 2024. In addition, the population of the birds is also stunning. On the March 20th in 2024, for example, we observed a swarm of around fourty Pied Avocet; the population of the coots also took the land around the internal lake every winter. Usually, we use excel to manage these data, which is stable, but requires additional effort to learn how to operate with it. Since most of our members are not computer science students, it would be too difficult for them to manage the data using excel.\n\nWe also lack of a platform to show people the data. When cooperating with the Campus Operation on the theme of 'Keeping the Weeds', we failed to persuade them to preserve the weeds permanentaly. One factor is that we did not present the data to intuitively show the effect of keeping weeds, because Excel lacks of flexibility and 'visualibility'. Not only the faculty, but also the students, are not aware of the biodiversity on our campus. During the Bird Conservation Week, participants seldom recognize the bird species, nor having a rough idea of why we are protecting them. As an amateur developer, the first step for the Bird Conservation Zhixing to raise the related awareness is to *make our data public*, and then to *make the data presents itself* to our community to tell the whole story of birds on campus.\n\n## Similar Product\n\n> These products are mature and powerful, but not useful for a small region like our campus.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240725114045.png> \"a\")\n\nThe most famous application to keep record and share these data is Ebird, developed by Cornell Lab. \n\n> Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education.

Then a dictionary is passed into the function as a param to return the result of filter.\n\npart of the code:\n```python\ndef record_query(q_dic):\n    bird_filter = None\n    if 'species' in q_dic:\n        species_ids = q_dic['species']\n        for species_id in species_ids:\n            if bird_filter:\n                bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id)) | bird_filter\n            else:\n                bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id))\n    elif 'bird_class_ids' in q_dic:\n        classes_ids = q_dic['bird_class_ids']\n        for classes_id in classes_ids:\n            classes_id = int(classes_id)\n            bird_class = BirdClasses.objects.get(id=classes_id)\n            birds = bird_class.birdinfo_set.all()\n            for bird in birds:\n                species_id = bird.id\n                if bird_filter:\n                    bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id)) | bird_filter\n                else:\n                    bird_filter = Q(bird_id=int(species_id))\n\n    # Other sub-filters\n\t# Add them all together using AND\n    api_filter = Q(date__range=time_interval)\n    if bird_filter:\n        api_filter = bird_filter & api_filter\n    if location_filter:\n        api_filter = location_filter & api_filter\n    if type_filter:\n        api_filter = type_filter & api_filter\n\n    return Records.objects.all().filter(api_filter).distinct()\n```\n\n#### Data Page (`/`) `show_data`\n\n> This page(view function) is responsible for showing the overall data(the distribution map, charts) and recieve user's filter form to fill out the data.\n\nIt first takes in the form. \n\nIf the form is valid, function `record_query` is called to filter the data according to the filter form. Then the filtered data is passed to render the `show_data.html`.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240726101923.png> \"a\")\n\nOtherwise, it will render the `show_data_initial.html` with the overall data. First, locations are obtained from the database, and for each location, aggregate functions are called to get the life and death data. Then `the total live and death observed` is calculated again through aggregate functions.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240725104937.png> \"a\")\n\n#### Download data in Json or CSV `record_api` and `record_get_csv`\n\n##### Json `record_api`\nAfter the data is filtered, there will be a button `Json` to allow export the data in the format of Json. \n\n```python\ndef record_api(request):\n    q_dic = convert_querydict2dict(request.GET)\n    record_result = models.record_query(q_dic)\n    json_data = RecordsSerializer(record_result, many=True).data\n    return JsonResponse(json_data, safe=False)\n```\n\nTo make the data in Json, a **serializer** is added.\n\n##### CSV `record_get_csv`\n\nData is obtained through `record_query`, and response type was specified. Then use the `writer` instance to write in the data rows.\n```python\nresponse = HttpResponse(content_type='text/csv')\nresponse['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; \n\tfilename=\"data.csv\"'\nresponse.write(codecs.BOM_UTF8)\nwriter = csv.writer(response)\n```\n\n#### location, species, classes pages `location_view` and `species_view` and `classes_view`\n\nAlthough their content are different, they have nearly the same code structure. First, the aggregated data is obtained from the database, and they are passed to the rendering. Additionally, to allow administrators to modify the content, the function also takes `POST` requests from authenticated users to get the updated content, like `name`, `description`, etc.\n\n#### Other functions\n\nJust use the basic filter to filter out the data accordingly, then render the data on the webpage. I ~~am just lazy~~ think it is too simple to explain.\n\n## Image Hosting App (Pic)\n\n### Database\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240726104056.png> \"a\")\n\nOnly one table. `Ori_img` is the original image's path in the storage, while `sml_img` is for the compressed images' path. `uploaded_at` is the date when uploaded.\n\n### Core Function: Upload and Manage Portal\n\nIt is just a simple example how an image was uploaded and displayed.\n\n```python\ndef receive_img(request):\n    form = ImageForm(request.POST, request.FILES)\n    if form.is_valid():\n        result = form.save()\n        return render(request, 'copy_redirect.html', {'link': result.link})\n    print(\"not valid image\")\n    return redirect('/img/add/')\n\ndef image_list(request):\n    images = Img.objects.all()\n    return render(request, 'image_list.html', {'images': images, })\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n> Initial on Tencent Lighthouse and Vercel, but the deployment was complicated, so I changed to Google Cloud Run.\n\nI hate deployment, since it always requires me to do configuration stuffs which are annoying. However, to make my application online, I have to do it.\n\n### Host Python things\n\n> Hosting a Python website is suffering. Finally, I host it on Google Cloud Run.\n\nI first managed to deploy my code on a raw server in Tencent Cloud. I managed to configure the Nginx, but failed, despite the fact that I studied the tutorials on the Internet for hours. I then found vercel, but the configuration file was just too complicated, and ChatGPT could not help me. **I finally turned to Google Cloud Run**, which has an example project which is quite simple. It just has an additional `proc` file and a `docker` configuration for me to complete. With little modification, my application successfully got online.\n\n### Bucket\n\nSince my application has media and static files, storing them in the Docker is unacceptable. I used Google's bucket to host both my media and static files. This is again an annoying task,  since the configuration was still a bit complex.\n\nFirst, you will need `django-storages[google]` and `gcsUtils` in your Python Environment. Then add in the `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nSTORAGES = {\n    \"default\": {\n        \"BACKEND\": \"storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage\",\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"location\": \"media/\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"staticfiles\": {\n        \"BACKEND\": \"storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage\",\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"location\": \"static2/\",\n        },\n    },\n}\n\nGS_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('GS_BUCKET_NAME')\nGS_PROJECT_ID = os.getenv('GS_PROJECT_ID')\nGS_DEFAULT_ACL = os.getenv('GS_DEFAULT_ACL')\n\nGS_FILE_OVERWRITE = False\n\nGS_CREDENTIALS = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'gcpCredentials.json'),\n)\n\nBUCKET_URL = os.getenv('BUCKET_URL')\n\nSTATIC_URL = os.path.join(BUCKET_URL, 'static2/')\nSTATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static2')\n\nMEDIA_URL = os.path.join(BUCKET_URL, 'media/')\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')\n```\n\nSince it's in production, these variables are loaded from the environment(I recommend you to do so). `GS_CREDENTIALS` should be loaded from the `Secret`, but the configuration was rather complex~~(lazy)~~. So, instead, I loaded it from a credential file.\n\nCreate a new file `gcsUtils.py` in the same directory with `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom storages.backends.gcloud import GoogleCloudStorage\n\nStatic = lambda: GoogleCloudStorage(location='static')\nMedia = lambda: GoogleCloudStorage(location='media')\n```\n\nAlthough there are just a few lines of modification, it takes me a week to figure them out. Crazy.\n\n### Database\n\nIf you want to get a database directly, the cost is significant. To save some money, I chose the lighthouse server on Tencent, and installed the MySQL myself. The server has 2 kernel and 2GB RAM, cost only 45 RMB per month.\n\n### Cloudflare(optional)\n\nI used Cloudflare as my DNS server to reduce bots' requests, to save some network fee.\n\n# Future\n\nThere are always things to improve. For example, since the google cloud run costs, it would still better to run my code on a lighthouse server, using the Baota([宝塔面板 (bt.cn)](https://www.bt.cn/new/index.html)). Also, the **readability** of my code should be better. Variables' name and annotation should be less ambiguous and 'random'. There are also **safety concern**, like the image host lack of mechanism to prevent inline linking. There are also lots of other things... ...\n\nApart from technical improvement, this project lack of social construction, since this project is built by myself alone. I am also looking for contributers to help me maintain and update this project(maybe).\n\n# Personal Reflection\n\n**It was such a rewarding journey.** I learnt almost every process of making a working dynamic website by myself, surprisingly for the first time. It was just a dream when I decided to make this project, and I was not certain I could finish it some day. However, I did it, thanks to my dedication and generative AI which empowered my learning speed.\n\n> _“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”_ — Shoyo Hinata \"Haikyuu!!\"\n","slug":"How-I-built-Webird","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.538Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44yo001lslij18o129w8","content":"<h1 id=\"Current-Situation\"><a href=\"#Current-Situation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Current Situation\"></a>Current Situation</h1><blockquote>\n<p>Birding data management and interpretation are two gaps that need to be filled in our Zhixing.

Our school has a variety of bird species, <em>79 different species had been spotted</em> until 2024. In addition, the population of the birds is also stunning. On the March 20th in 2024, for example, we observed a swarm of around fourty Pied Avocet; the population of the coots also took the land around the internal lake every winter. Usually, we use excel to manage these data, which is stable, but requires additional effort to learn how to operate with it. Since most of our members are not computer science students, it would be too difficult for them to manage the data using excel.</p>\n<p>We also lack of a platform to show people the data. When cooperating with the Campus Operation on the theme of ‘Keeping the Weeds’, we failed to persuade them to preserve the weeds permanentaly. One factor is that we did not present the data to intuitively show the effect of keeping weeds, because Excel lacks of flexibility and ‘visualibility’. Not only the faculty, but also the students, are not aware of the biodiversity on our campus. During the Bird Conservation Week, participants seldom recognize the bird species, nor having a rough idea of why we are protecting them. As an amateur developer, the first step for the Bird Conservation Zhixing to raise the related awareness is to <em>make our data public</em>, and then to <em>make the data presents itself</em> to our community to tell the whole story of birds on campus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Similar-Product\"><a href=\"#Similar-Product\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Similar Product\"></a>Similar Product</h2><blockquote>\n<p>These products are mature and powerful, but not useful for a small region like our campus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240725114045.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>The most famous application to keep record and share these data is Ebird, developed by Cornell Lab. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education.

Although it supports location based on latitude and langtitude, the decimals are not accurate enough to distinguish the sub-places on campus. Thus, it cannot show the overall distribution of birds on campus. Furthermore, Ebird does not support recording for bird strike on windows. These all make Ebird disqualified for the job in our Zhixing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"History-of-Webird\"><a href=\"#History-of-Webird\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"History of Webird\"></a>History of Webird</h1><h2 id=\"Initial-Plan\"><a href=\"#Initial-Plan\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Initial Plan\"></a>Initial Plan</h2><p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A beautiful map to show birds distribution over space;</li>\n<li>Record management(add&#x2F;delete&#x2F;filtering&#x2F;edit), distinguishing normal records and strikes;</li>\n<li>Species management(connected with record);</li>\n<li>Gallery to show images(Optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I had never made a great project like this myself, so I did not take time to design the detail.

Powered by Python.’ This tool’s original aim is to help you build a content-oriented blog website, but the simplicity draws my attention. With just a line of command, I can generate the whole static website. I soon started to work using this tool.</p>\n<p>Since this is a static website generator and one of my aim was to create a dynamic one, <em>I thought of a way to make it dynamic without knowing anything about database</em>. As I learnt how to operate with Excel using Python in the past, I created a script with several functions to use Excel as a database, not aware of myself building a database. I created several sheets as different table to store data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Records(id, species unique name, quantity, time, location unique name)</li>\n<li>Species(id, species unique name, description, translated name)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A script was created to allow adding record data. The user just needs to write a markdown file as a post with the category <code>record</code> and current date, and after that with record data like the following format:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">LittleEgret:</span> <span class=\"number\">3</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Coot:</span> <span class=\"number\">2</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Unknown:</span> <span class=\"number\">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>When generating the website, a script will automatically sync the data in these markdown posts with the Excel file, and use these aggregate functions I wrote to get the location and species’ sum, average and median. To make a beautiful map, I created a post with the date 2077, so that it always stays on top, with an HTML code illustrating the map with markers embedded in it.</p>\n<p>Although this tool achieves all the goals I set, this is still not ideal. The biggest issue is that this system lacks of an easy way for members to add records. Adding records without a GUI is completely unacceptable for any member of the Bird Conservation Zhixing. Thus, I headed another way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Dynamic-Website-from-Scratch-Django\"><a href=\"#Dynamic-Website-from-Scratch-Django\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dynamic Website from Scratch (Django)\"></a>Dynamic Website from Scratch (Django)</h2><blockquote>\n<p>Meet the requirement, easy to maintain or add new function, but takes time to learn how to master it (still not quite a master of it).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240725104937.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I took time to learn how to operate with database(SQL) and Django through Bilibili(<a href=\"https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ\">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ</a>) for at least a month, and with the assistance from ChatGPT.

Our school has a variety of bird species, <em>79 different species had been spotted</em> until 2024. In addition, the population of the birds is also stunning. On the March 20th in 2024, for example, we observed a swarm of around fourty Pied Avocet; the population of the coots also took the land around the internal lake every winter. Usually, we use excel to manage these data, which is stable, but requires additional effort to learn how to operate with it. Since most of our members are not computer science students, it would be too difficult for them to manage the data using excel.</p>\n<p>We also lack of a platform to show people the data. When cooperating with the Campus Operation on the theme of ‘Keeping the Weeds’, we failed to persuade them to preserve the weeds permanentaly. One factor is that we did not present the data to intuitively show the effect of keeping weeds, because Excel lacks of flexibility and ‘visualibility’. Not only the faculty, but also the students, are not aware of the biodiversity on our campus. During the Bird Conservation Week, participants seldom recognize the bird species, nor having a rough idea of why we are protecting them. As an amateur developer, the first step for the Bird Conservation Zhixing to raise the related awareness is to <em>make our data public</em>, and then to <em>make the data presents itself</em> to our community to tell the whole story of birds on campus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Similar-Product\"><a href=\"#Similar-Product\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Similar Product\"></a>Similar Product</h2><blockquote>\n<p>These products are mature and powerful, but not useful for a small region like our campus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240725114045.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>The most famous application to keep record and share these data is Ebird, developed by Cornell Lab. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education.

Although it supports location based on latitude and langtitude, the decimals are not accurate enough to distinguish the sub-places on campus.

Powered by Python.’ This tool’s original aim is to help you build a content-oriented blog website, but the simplicity draws my attention. With just a line of command, I can generate the whole static website. I soon started to work using this tool.</p>\n<p>Since this is a static website generator and one of my aim was to create a dynamic one, <em>I thought of a way to make it dynamic without knowing anything about database</em>. As I learnt how to operate with Excel using Python in the past, I created a script with several functions to use Excel as a database, not aware of myself building a database. I created several sheets as different table to store data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Records(id, species unique name, quantity, time, location unique name)</li>\n<li>Species(id, species unique name, description, translated name)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A script was created to allow adding record data. The user just needs to write a markdown file as a post with the category <code>record</code> and current date, and after that with record data like the following format:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">LittleEgret:</span> <span class=\"number\">3</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Coot:</span> <span class=\"number\">2</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Unknown:</span> <span class=\"number\">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>When generating the website, a script will automatically sync the data in these markdown posts with the Excel file, and use these aggregate functions I wrote to get the location and species’ sum, average and median. To make a beautiful map, I created a post with the date 2077, so that it always stays on top, with an HTML code illustrating the map with markers embedded in it.</p>\n<p>Although this tool achieves all the goals I set, this is still not ideal. The biggest issue is that this system lacks of an easy way for members to add records. Adding records without a GUI is completely unacceptable for any member of the Bird Conservation Zhixing. Thus, I headed another way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Dynamic-Website-from-Scratch-Django\"><a href=\"#Dynamic-Website-from-Scratch-Django\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dynamic Website from Scratch (Django)\"></a>Dynamic Website from Scratch (Django)</h2><blockquote>\n<p>Meet the requirement, easy to maintain or add new function, but takes time to learn how to master it (still not quite a master of it).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240725104937.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I took time to learn how to operate with database(SQL) and Django through Bilibili(<a href=\"https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ\">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ</a>) for at least a month, and with the assistance from ChatGPT.

These tales are elevated to a near-sacred status, yet the memories most cherished by the heroes themselves often vanish into the river of history, forgotten and overlooked.\n\nThe anime *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* adapts the manga by Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe, weaving a tale that begins where most epics end. (**Plot summary**: After a ten-year journey, a hero’s party defeats the Demon King. The story picks up long after, exploring life in the aftermath of such a legendary adventure.) \n\nUsing the concept of “epiphanies,” the series merges objective clock time with subjective psychological time. Through a blend of chronological and retrospective storytelling, it employs a thousand-year lens to immortalize fleeting, overlooked moments—those \"ordinary\" times that turn extraordinary when viewed in hindsight.\n\n---\n\n### 1. A Chronological Perspective\n\n#### 1.1 Frieren’s Unique Sense of Time and Emotional Perception\n\n> From dismissing the significance of a decade-long adventure, to showing indifference even at Himmel’s funeral, Frieren’s initial reactions reveal her detachment. She rejects Heiter’s request to mentor Fern and initially interacts with Fern with cold distance.\n\nAs an elf, Frieren’s perception of time, mortality, and farewells differs vastly from that of humans. \n\n#### 1.2 The Temporal Clash Between Elves and Humans\n\n> Celebrating the defeat of the Demon King with a banquet, the promise to reunite in “just 50 years” for a meteor shower, and Frieren’s relentless search for rare Cazue grass, spanning years—all highlight the tension between human brevity and elven eternity.\n\nFor humans, “stillness resembles eternity, and days stretch like years.” For Frieren, the reverse holds true: “eternity blossoms endlessly, while years feel like fleeting days.” Much like a mayfly and a tortoise, their lifespans render mutual understanding elusive.\n\n#### 1.3 Narrative Focus\n\nFrench literary theorist Gérard Genette introduced the concept of **focalization** in his work *Narrative Discourse*. Focalization asks: who is the psychological or emotional lens through which the narrative is filtered? Whose eyes and mind color the story being told?\n\nIn *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*, the narrative often adopts the perspective of Frieren, filtering the world through her unique sense of time and emotional depth. This approach enables viewers to experience events through her evolving consciousness and inner reflections.\n\n> The ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King occupies only a brief segment of the series. The story’s focus shifts to Frieren’s return to the same locations, where the traces of her former companions are fading into legend, leaving behind hollow myths.\n\nBy juxtaposing human and elven perceptions of time, the series deepens its exploration of narrative focus and temporal dissonance.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Epiphanies and the Role of Flashbacks\n\n#### 2.1 What is an Epiphany?\n\nAn **epiphany** is a moment of sudden realization—a flash of understanding that disrupts the normal flow of time in the story. These instances are pivotal for Frieren, as they often freeze the narrative, revealing key shifts in her psychological state.\n\nEpiphanies in *Frieren* connect the sequential and retrospective layers of the story, intertwining moments from the hero’s tale with her present journey.\n\n#### 2.2 How Are Epiphanies Triggered?\n\nEpiphanies are frequently linked to objects in the physical world. As Frieren observes various scenes or people, her gaze eventually settles on something specific—a seemingly ordinary object imbued with profound meaning. These objects hold the power to unearth hidden memories or insights, drawing the audience into the emotional depth of the moment.\n\nExamples include the Cazue grass, a rusted ring, or a weathered statue. Each item serves as a focal point that triggers flashbacks and recollections.\n\n#### 2.3 What Do Epiphanies Uncover?\n\nIn *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*, epiphanies grant the protagonist new insights, propelling the story forward while adding layers of emotional depth to the narrative. On a broader scale, these moments bring new meaning to the world itself.\n\n> One such scene involves Himmel’s memory: Frieren revisits a field of daisies where she recalls Himmel once gifting her a flower crown. Cleaning his statue, she uses her magic to recreate the meadow, placing a wreath of Cazue grass—a flower symbolizing gratitude—on the statue.\n\nThrough these acts, Frieren not only honors the past but also renews the audience’s reverence for the hero’s legacy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Mastering the Art of Detail\n\nGenette also argues that time in narrative chains is both consistent and malleable. While clock time remains steady, storytelling techniques—like sequencing and montage—distort the perception of time, adding emotional depth.\n\nTake Episode 2 as an example.\n\nGuided by a seed mouse, Frieren and Fern discover Cazue grass atop a lighthouse. Through a mix of long shots and slow motion, the scene magnifies the moment, giving viewers a level of detail and emotional resonance impossible to capture in real-time. **Time is stretched**, creating a poetic impression that lingers in the viewer’s mind.\n\n> When Frieren gazes at Himmel’s statue and recalls adjusting his pose, the scene’s physical clock only accounts for a glance. Yet within this brief moment, half a year of narrative time passes. Similarly, when Fern asks why Frieren enjoys magic, her simple response—“Because there was a fool who praised me for it”—triggers a cascade of memories.\n\nOrdinary moments, overlooked in their time, leave eternal imprints in memory.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Conclusion: What’s Your Time Lens?\n\n*Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* offers a thousand-year perspective through the eyes of an elf, while works like *The Story of My Life* by Helen Keller provide a contrasting lens—just three days of vision.\n\nWhat lens do you use to focus your narrative? A millennium? A century? Three days? Or the fleeting instant of the present?  \n\nEach perspective carries its own power to turn the ordinary into something eternal.","source":"_posts/Narrative-Focus-and-Epiphanies-in-Frieren-Beyond-Journey’s-End.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Narrative Focus and Epiphanies in Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End'\ndate: 2024-11-19 12:39:08\ntags: [anime, Frieren Beyond Journeys End]\ncategories: thought\n---\n\n## Narrative Focus and Epiphanies in *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*\n\n> Think of the typical heroic epics—like the story of Joan of Arc.

It connects with the modern internet phenomenon of \"**only destroying without rebuilding**\", where people frequently tear down ideas or individuals online without offering constructive alternatives.\n\n\n> original Chinese article: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/t8Rr5RrJDNKOSpsdYrzajA\n> The following is originally translated by HiddenBlue. (The original author is Caoguo)\n\n# \"Nonviolence Is Key to Communication\"\n\n> Anger Drains Energy, But Relying on It Is Worse\n\nI’ve always considered myself someone who values reason, and I’ve even pursued a career where I not only have to be reasonable but also teach others to be the same. As a result, I often find myself in situations where reason seems utterly useless. If I were never reasonable, this wouldn't bother me. If most people were reasonable, I wouldn’t feel so anxious. Last year, I saw a news report about a security guard stabbing a food delivery worker to death. My first reaction was: someone is being unreasonable. This summer, I saw news about a bank president killing his superior and a woman in a Range Rover assaulting someone for not yielding. I realized that unreasonable people come from all walks of life, regardless of gender or class. More recently, I’ve been reading news about the back-and-forth rocket attacks between Israel and Iran-backed forces, along with various commentary driven by preconceived biases, and I realized there are barely any people left in the world who care about being reasonable. **Even I, at times, don’t feel like being reasonable.**\n\nGradually, I’ve come to realize that getting angry doesn’t solve problems—it only creates new ones. However, by creating new problems, there’s a chance the other party might change their attitude, if only out of fear that things might escalate further. Whether it gets better or worse is another matter, but the turning point often comes from this. There's a saying: \"When you lose it, the world becomes quiet.\" But every time I lose my temper, I feel completely drained—not only mentally but also physically, with noticeable symptoms like a sore throat, headache, and chest tightness. So, I always remind myself to stay calm and not get angry, no matter the situation. Does it work? If it did, I wouldn’t be writing this post.\n\nA few years ago, there was a popular book called *Nonviolent Communication*. While I admire the author, I can’t help but feel disheartened. From my personal experience and what I’ve witnessed, violence is often the most effective way of communicating. From warring countries exchanging missiles to two ordinary people hurling insults, from physical altercations to online keyboard warriors—violence is everywhere in our communication.

So, I’ve been playing with an idea: <strong>What if we took a decentralized approach to moderation?</strong> Something that fosters trust and rational communication while cutting down on the extreme, harmful stuff we all encounter online.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"The-Big-Idea\"><a href=\"#The-Big-Idea\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Big Idea\"></a><strong>The Big Idea</strong></h4><p>Imagine a social network where users are assigned to <strong>small, diverse groups</strong> (fewer than 20 people) at random. Each group has multiple <strong>leaders</strong>, who are responsible for making sure the content follows customed group guidelines. If someone in the group gets flagged, these leaders step in—either stopping the harmful behavior or having a direct conversation with the user to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>The cool part? Leadership isn’t static. As users gain experience on the platform, they can become eligible to lead new groups. This way, the system evolves as the community grows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"Challenges-and-Some-Thoughts-on-Solutions\"><a href=\"#Challenges-and-Some-Thoughts-on-Solutions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Challenges and Some Thoughts on Solutions\"></a><strong>Challenges and Some Thoughts on Solutions</strong></h4><ol>\n<li><p><strong>Group Dynamics</strong>: Randomly assigned groups might sound chaotic. Will everyone actually get along?<br><strong>My Take</strong>: By focusing on building a culture of trust and coherence from the get-go, we can encourage people to collaborate and communicate more constructively. A little culture-building goes a long way.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Picking Leaders</strong>: Who decides who gets to be a leader? This part is tricky and honestly, it could be controversial.<br><strong>For Now</strong>: I think it makes sense to tie leadership to experience—using a transparent system based on contributions and engagement. We’ll dive deeper into how this could work later.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Trust and Transparency</strong>: It’s key that users feel like the leaders are fair and accountable.<br><strong>Solution</strong>: Adding feedback and appeal mechanisms should help with this. If leaders aren’t being fair, people need to have a way to address that.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Avoiding Echo Chambers</strong>: It’s all too easy for groups to fall into echo chambers, but I’m hoping the diversity and strong leadership will help combat that.<br><strong>Thoughts</strong>: By having fair leaders, we can make sure all voices in the group are heard and that discussions stay balanced.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Scaling</strong>: As the network grows, we’ll need to ensure quality doesn’t drop.<br><strong>Plan</strong>: New groups will be created as more users join, and experienced members will step up as leaders. Having multiple leaders in each group ensures no one person is overwhelmed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"Where-We-Go-From-Here\"><a href=\"#Where-We-Go-From-Here\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Where We Go From Here\"></a><strong>Where We Go From Here</strong></h4><p>This idea is still evolving, but I’m excited about where it’s heading.

I started working on a decentralized social network to tackle some big challenges: keeping conversations rational, protecting privacy, and reducing harmful behavior without relying on a central authority. But as I worked through it, I realized this design could go way beyond just social networking. Here’s how it all started as a concrete idea, got distilled into its core elements, and ended up as a flexible framework for decentralized interaction.\n\n## The Starting Point: A Social Network with Autonomy and Privacy at Its Core\n\nMy initial concept was straightforward: build a social network where users could have more control over who they connected with and how they interacted. Here’s what it looked like:\n\n1. **Discovery Servers (DS)**: I introduced these to help people find and connect with others.\n   - **Public DS** would be for anyone to join, while **Private DS** would work for more closed settings, like companies or schools.\n\n2. **Connection Protocol**: Every connection required a **secret key** shared between two users. The beauty of this was that both parties had the power to end the connection whenever they wanted. Connections were private, consent-driven, and totally in control of the people involved.\n\n3. **Indirect Connection Requests**: If you wanted to connect with someone you didn’t have a direct link to, you could use an intermediary—a friend of a friend. In this model, Discovery Servers were like \"special friends\" that only helped with introductions, not controlling anything. \n\nThe setup felt fresh because, unlike traditional networks, there was no central authority overseeing everything. Users kept their privacy through keys, and connection requests made through friends of friends added a layer of trust. It was a social network built on consent and autonomy.\n\n## Stepping Back: Turning It into a More Flexible Network Model\n\nI realized that the design could be even more flexible if I focused less on “social network” features and more on the core protocols for connection. This gave rise to two basic protocols:\n\n1. **Direct Connection Protocol**: A simple, secure link between two people based on mutual consent and a shared key.\n2. **Request Connection Protocol**: For situations where two people didn’t have a direct link. Here, an intermediary—someone already connected to both—could act as a bridge. \n\nThis model made Discovery Servers just another type of participant, or “node,” in the network. They helped people find connections without having control over them. It wasn’t just a social network model anymore; this could work for any network where privacy and trusted connections were needed.\n\n## Going Deeper: Generalizing to Units, Links, and Facilitators\n\nI started seeing that the network could be even simpler and more universal. I stripped away all the specifics like “users,” “servers,” and even “nodes.” Here’s what I landed on:\n\n1. **Units**: Any independent participant in the network could be a “unit.” Whether it was a person, a company, or something else, a unit could choose its own connections and how it interacted with others.\n\n2. **Links**: Connections between units were now just “links,” each with a unique key as a form of mutual consent. Links could be direct (between two units) or indirect (using a third unit as a bridge).\n\n3. **Dynamic Facilitators**: In cases where a group needed to stay connected, one unit could take on the temporary role of a **facilitator** to coordinate the conversation. And if another unit had better network conditions, the role could switch over—keeping things efficient.\n\nThis stripped-down setup meant the network was even more adaptable. Any type of unit could connect and organize itself in whatever way made sense, and links were always private and flexible. Now it felt like a true, decentralized system that could work for way more than just social connections.\n\n## The Ultimate Abstraction: Elements, Connections, and Rules\n\nFinally, I wondered, how simple could I make it? I wanted to see if I could reduce the model to its bare bones without losing any of its core ideas. Here’s the ultra-abstract version that I came up with:\n\n1. **Elements**: Any independent entity in the system. Each element decides its own connections and controls how it engages with others.\n\n2. **Connections**: Secure links between elements that allow for interactions. These connections are always based on mutual agreement, so either side can terminate them whenever they want. Connections can be direct or indirect, using intermediaries when needed.\n\n3. **Interaction Rules**:\n   - **Direct Connection Rule**: Elements connect directly if they both agree.\n   - **Indirect Connection Rule**: Elements can connect indirectly through another element, adding a layer of trust and privacy.\n   - **Dynamic Role Assignment Rule**: If a group of elements needs temporary coordination, one element can step up as a facilitator. This role can change hands as needed, keeping things flexible and efficient.\n\nAnd that was it. This ultra-abstract model boiled down to just elements, connections, and some basic rules about how they interact. It could be applied to any kind of decentralized system—social networks, resource-sharing systems, even collaboration platforms. It was a system that focused on autonomy, privacy, and adaptability, with connections that grew organically and didn’t need any central authority.\n\n## Why This Matters: A Foundation for Decentralized Systems\n\nThe journey from concrete social network to ultra-abstract framework showed me that a few simple principles—autonomy, consent, privacy, and flexibility—can support almost any decentralized network. By focusing on just these essentials, the model could adapt to nearly any context while staying true to what makes decentralized systems powerful.\n\nIn a world where centralized control often limits privacy and individual choice, this decentralized interaction model opens up possibilities. Whether you’re building a new kind of social network, a resource-sharing community, or a collaborative workspace, this framework provides the foundation for a truly user-driven, adaptive network that lets each participant stay in control.\n\n---\n\n**Wrapping Up**: Decentralization doesn’t have to mean complexity. By focusing on simplicity and core values, we can create networks that respect autonomy and privacy while being flexible enough to meet diverse needs. This framework offers a way forward—a blueprint for building decentralized systems that are adaptable, resilient, and, most importantly, human-centered.\n","source":"_posts/Rethinking-Social-Network-Again.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Rethinking Social Network(Again)\ndate: 2024-11-10 19:57:11\ntags: \ncategories: thought\n---\n\n> This is an upgrade to my previous post: [Rethinking Social Networks | Untitled Dream](https://blog.gu33gu.asia/2024/11/06/Rethinking-Social-Networks/)\n\n\n# From Social Network Idea to Universal Framework: A Journey into Decentralization\n\nSometimes, the best ideas start with a specific goal in mind and end up taking on a life of their own.

It was a system that focused on autonomy, privacy, and adaptability, with connections that grew organically and didn’t need any central authority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-This-Matters-A-Foundation-for-Decentralized-Systems\"><a href=\"#Why-This-Matters-A-Foundation-for-Decentralized-Systems\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why This Matters: A Foundation for Decentralized Systems\"></a>Why This Matters: A Foundation for Decentralized Systems</h2><p>The journey from concrete social network to ultra-abstract framework showed me that a few simple principles—autonomy, consent, privacy, and flexibility—can support almost any decentralized network. By focusing on just these essentials, the model could adapt to nearly any context while staying true to what makes decentralized systems powerful.</p>\n<p>In a world where centralized control often limits privacy and individual choice, this decentralized interaction model opens up possibilities. Whether you’re building a new kind of social network, a resource-sharing community, or a collaborative workspace, this framework provides the foundation for a truly user-driven, adaptive network that lets each participant stay in control.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong>: Decentralization doesn’t have to mean complexity. By focusing on simplicity and core values, we can create networks that respect autonomy and privacy while being flexible enough to meet diverse needs. This framework offers a way forward—a blueprint for building decentralized systems that are adaptable, resilient, and, most importantly, human-centered.</p>\n"},{"title":"Service Unavailable Error Solution","date":"2024-10-14T10:30:07.000Z","_content":"# Debugging 'Service Unavailable' Errors in Dockerized Flask Apps with Gunicorn\n\n> Deploying a Flask app with Docker and Gunicorn can sometimes lead to frustrating `\"Service Unavailable\"` errors without helpful logs.

This inspired me to make a Chatbot that simulates human's thought to have more realistic and immersive experience in roleplaying conversation.\n\nIn this blog, I'll walk you through building a conversational chatbot with **Gradio** and **LangGraph**. This chatbot incorporates a **dual-mind design** to balance **rational** and **emotional** responses, and uses **imagination** to complete settings dynamically. Additionally, I’ll show how **prompt enhancement** leads to concise yet impactful responses.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture\n\n![](<https:\\blog.gu33gu.asia\\\\_resources\\Pasted image 20250201232758.png> \"a\")\n\n### Dual Mind Design: Rational vs. Emotional\n\nThe chatbot features a **dual-mind design**, where it generates responses through **two lenses**: **rational** and **emotional**. This helps make the conversation feel more natural, as the chatbot adapts based on the context.\n\n#### Rational Processing:\n\nThe rational part of the chatbot generates logical, structured responses. For instance, if the user asks for advice, the bot responds with a clear, methodical breakdown:\n\n```python\ndef process_rational(state: BotState):\n    \"\"\"Generate a structured and logical response.\"\"\"\n    user_memory = state[\"long_term_memory\"]\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n\"You are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}.\n\nYou are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}.\nYou speak logically in {settings['rational_processing']['style']}, focusing on {settings['rational_processing']['focus']}.\n\n## Player Context:\n{user_memory}\n\n## Player’s Question:\n\"{state['message']}\"\n\n## Response Format:\nProvide a structured, rational answer.\n\"\"\"\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    state[\"rational_output\"] = response.content\n    return {\"rational_output\": response.content}\n```\n\nThis method ensures that the chatbot's answers focus on logics, simulating the rational thoughts in the character.\n\n#### Emotional Processing:\n\nOn the flip side, the chatbot also generates emotionally rich responses to foster an engaging role-playing experience. Here's how we handle **emotional processing**:\n\n```python\ndef process_emotional(state: BotState):\n    \"\"\"Generate an emotionally engaging response.\"\"\"\n    session_memory = state[\"conversation_memory\"]\n    user_memory = state[\"long_term_memory\"]\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n\"You are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}.\nYou speak in {settings['emotional_processing']['style']}, focusing on {settings['emotional_processing']['focus']}.\n\n## Task:\nAnswer the player’s words with emotion in a stream of consciousness.\n\n## Player Context:\n{user_memory}\n\n## Your Background:\n{settings[\"character\"][\"background\"]}\n\n## Player’s Words:\n\"{state['message']}\"\n\n## Response Format:\nGenerate an immersive response in 100 words.\n\"\"\"\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    state[\"emotional_output\"] = response.content\n    return {\"emotional_output\":response.content}\n```\n\nHere, the chatbot taps into **emotion** and **mysticism** to provide a response that is **immersive** and **evocative**, simulating the emotion emerged in a character. This is crucial in a role-playing scenario where emotional engagement can enhance the storytelling experience.\n\n### Imagination for Setting Completion\n\nAn essential feature of the bot is its ability to **imagine** the setting when certain information is missing. For example, if the context doesn’t provide enough details, the bot can **fill in the blanks** with an imaginative description:\n\n```python\ndef imagine(state: BotState):\n    user_memory = state[\"long_term_memory\"]\n    conversation_mem = state[\"conversation_memory\"][\"history\"]\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n\"You are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}, {settings['character']['personality']}.\n\n## Your Background\n{settings['character']['background']}\n\n## Your Memory:\n- Conversation Memory: {conversation_mem}\n- User's Information: {user_memory}\n- Latest User Message: {state['message']}\n\n## Task:\nYou are trying to complete the setting in this role-playing game by imagining them.\nIf the past conversation does not reveal sufficient information about your setting, imagine your current situation and output them to make your situation clear and complete.\nFor example, you can imagine your past and the scene in the current room.\n\n## Final Response:\nGenerate an **immersive setting that complete the setting in previous conversation** and **coherent to previous conversation**.\nThe word count should be under 100 words.\n\"\"\"\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    return {\"setting_imagine\": response.content}\n```\n\nThis function helps the bot to **dynamically generate settings** for the player to interact with, ensuring the role-playing experience feels **alive and ever-evolving**.\n\n### Prompt Enhancement: Longer ≠ Better\n\nIn the context of prompt engineering, it's essential to remember that **longer prompts** don't necessarily result in better outcomes. In fact, **concise and clear prompts** tend to lead to more focused and precise answers.\n\nFor example, in the **finalize** node of the chatbot, the prompt is designed to be **short yet effective**:\n\n```python\ndef finalize(state: BotState):\n    \"\"\"Final node that integrates emotional and rational responses and updates memory.\"\"\"\n    session_memory = state[\"conversation_memory\"]\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}.\n\n## Inputs:\n- Original Response: {state[\"final_response\"]}\n- Emotional Response: {state[\"emotional_output\"]}\n- Rational Response: {state[\"rational_output\"]}\n- Past Conversation: {state['conversation_memory'][\"history\"]}\n- Latest User Message: {state['message']}\n- Situation: {state[\"setting_imagine\"]}\n\n## Task:\nCreate an in-character response that integrates both emotional and rational aspects, making it immersive and cohesive with the ongoing conversation. Use details from the past conversation and the situation to ensure continuity.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Maintain {settings['processing_weights']['emotional_percentage']}% emotion and {settings['processing_weights']['rational_percentage']}% logic.\n- Prioritize user preferences according to {settings['integration_rules'][\"user_preference_priority\"]}.\n- Match your tone with {settings['integration_rules']['output_tone']} and avoid repeating greetings or redundant statements.\n- Stay within the character’s established voice and ensure your response contributes directly to the flow of the conversation.\n- If the user is passive or withdrawn, respond gently and empathetically, offering support or a shift in topic without pushing them to be more active. Consider the context and balance engagement without forcing the interaction.\n\n## Final Response:\nYour response should be under 100 words.\n\"\"\"\n\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    state[\"final_response\"] = response.content\n    return {\n        \"final_response\": response.content,\n    }\n```\n\nHere, we focus on **clarity** rather than length, ensuring the **bot's final output** is **contextually relevant**, **cohesive**, and **succinct**. I used ChatGPT to enhance the prompt.\n\n```prompt\nYou are a skilled prompt engineer. Your task is to improve this prompt to make sure the roleplaying llm is able to make the response coherent to previous conversation:\n\nbluh bluh bluh...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Frontend: Why Gradio?\n\n**Gradio** is a powerful library that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning applications. It allows for quick prototyping and testing by offering easy-to-use, interactive interfaces, making it perfect for our chatbot. Here's how we use **Gradio** to build the chat interface for our **role-playing AI chatbot**:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\n# Define the chatbot response function\ndef chatbot_response(message: str, history: list):\n    # Code for processing the message using LangGraph\n    return bot_response\n\n# Create a Gradio chat interface\nchatbot_ui = gr.ChatInterface(\n    fn=chatbot_response,\n    type=\"messages\",\n    title=\"Role-Playing AI Chatbot\",\n    description=\"Engage in immersive storytelling with an AI-driven role-playing character.\",\n)\n\n# Launch the Gradio UI\nchatbot_ui.launch()\n```\n\nIn this snippet, we define a simple **chatbot_response** function that uses **LangGraph** to process the messages and maintain the conversation history. **Gradio** then creates the chat interface, making it easy to interact with the bot.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy **imaginatively filling gaps in the setting** and carefully crafting **concise architecture** with **clear prompts**, we've developed an engaging and dynamic conversational AI that responds coherently and immersively.\n\n","source":"_posts/Role-Play-Bot-with-Gradio-and-LangGraph-Dual-Mind-Design-Re.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Role-Play Bot with Gradio and LangGraph: Dual-Mind Design Re'\ndate: 2025-02-01 23:37:58\ntags: [re, LangGraph, Python, recommended]\ncategories: code\n---\n\n# Role-Play Bot with Gradio and LangGraph: Dual-Mind Design\n\nlink to repo -> [gugu-py/dual_hearts_roleplay](https://github.com/gugu-py/dual_hearts_roleplay)\n\nThis project starts with a random talk on Chinese new year eve, when Gorden was testing his 6B model ~~as his daughter~~.

In fact, **concise and clear prompts** tend to lead to more focused and precise answers.\n\nFor example, in the **finalize** node of the chatbot, the prompt is designed to be **short yet effective**:\n\n```python\ndef finalize(state: BotState):\n    \"\"\"Final node that integrates emotional and rational responses and updates memory.\"\"\"\n    session_memory = state[\"conversation_memory\"]\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are {settings['character']['name']}, {settings['character']['role']}.\n\n## Inputs:\n- Original Response: {state[\"final_response\"]}\n- Emotional Response: {state[\"emotional_output\"]}\n- Rational Response: {state[\"rational_output\"]}\n- Past Conversation: {state['conversation_memory'][\"history\"]}\n- Latest User Message: {state['message']}\n- Situation: {state[\"setting_imagine\"]}\n\n## Task:\nCreate an in-character response that integrates both emotional and rational aspects, making it immersive and cohesive with the ongoing conversation. Use details from the past conversation and the situation to ensure continuity.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Maintain {settings['processing_weights']['emotional_percentage']}% emotion and {settings['processing_weights']['rational_percentage']}% logic.\n- Prioritize user preferences according to {settings['integration_rules'][\"user_preference_priority\"]}.\n- Match your tone with {settings['integration_rules']['output_tone']} and avoid repeating greetings or redundant statements.\n- Stay within the character’s established voice and ensure your response contributes directly to the flow of the conversation.\n- If the user is passive or withdrawn, respond gently and empathetically, offering support or a shift in topic without pushing them to be more active. Consider the context and balance engagement without forcing the interaction.\n\n## Final Response:\nYour response should be under 100 words.\n\"\"\"\n\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    state[\"final_response\"] = response.content\n    return {\n        \"final_response\": response.content,\n    }\n```\n\nHere, we focus on **clarity** rather than length, ensuring the **bot's final output** is **contextually relevant**, **cohesive**, and **succinct**. I used ChatGPT to enhance the prompt.\n\n```prompt\nYou are a skilled prompt engineer. Your task is to improve this prompt to make sure the roleplaying llm is able to make the response coherent to previous conversation:\n\nbluh bluh bluh...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Frontend: Why Gradio?\n\n**Gradio** is a powerful library that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning applications. It allows for quick prototyping and testing by offering easy-to-use, interactive interfaces, making it perfect for our chatbot. Here's how we use **Gradio** to build the chat interface for our **role-playing AI chatbot**:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\n# Define the chatbot response function\ndef chatbot_response(message: str, history: list):\n    # Code for processing the message using LangGraph\n    return bot_response\n\n# Create a Gradio chat interface\nchatbot_ui = gr.ChatInterface(\n    fn=chatbot_response,\n    type=\"messages\",\n    title=\"Role-Playing AI Chatbot\",\n    description=\"Engage in immersive storytelling with an AI-driven role-playing character.\",\n)\n\n# Launch the Gradio UI\nchatbot_ui.launch()\n```\n\nIn this snippet, we define a simple **chatbot_response** function that uses **LangGraph** to process the messages and maintain the conversation history. **Gradio** then creates the chat interface, making it easy to interact with the bot.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy **imaginatively filling gaps in the setting** and carefully crafting **concise architecture** with **clear prompts**, we've developed an engaging and dynamic conversational AI that responds coherently and immersively.\n\n","slug":"Role-Play-Bot-with-Gradio-and-LangGraph-Dual-Mind-Design-Re","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.538Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44yw002cslij7a1lelcf","content":"<h1 id=\"Role-Play-Bot-with-Gradio-and-LangGraph-Dual-Mind-Design\"><a href=\"#Role-Play-Bot-with-Gradio-and-LangGraph-Dual-Mind-Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Role-Play Bot with Gradio and LangGraph: Dual-Mind Design\"></a>Role-Play Bot with Gradio and LangGraph: Dual-Mind Design</h1><p>link to repo -&gt; <a href=\"https://github.com/gugu-py/dual_hearts_roleplay\">gugu-py&#x2F;dual_hearts_roleplay</a></p>\n<p>This project starts with a random talk on Chinese new year eve, when Gorden was testing his 6B model <del>as his daughter</del>.

Introduction\nIn a world where technology can craft more evocative **love letters** than ordinary human beings, the authenticity of expressing love fades. As people recognize that others rely on AI to articulate their feelings, traditional love letters vanish, making the act of showing love increasingly difficult and rendering emotional expression itself **devalued**. In a society increasingly defined by technology and **commodification**, we risk losing the essence of what it means to be human, as reflected in **Foucault’s** ideas, the narrative of *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, and the implications of technological advancement.\n\n\n## 2. Foucault’s Perspective on Power and Knowledge\n### 2.1 Power as Omnipresent\n**Michel Foucault** posits that power is not merely held by institutions; rather, it is diffused and pervasive throughout society. This notion challenges us to recognize how societal structures shape **identity** and experiences. In contemporary culture, technology acts as a new form of power, influencing our interactions and perceptions of self.\n\n### 2.2 Knowledge as Constructed\nFoucault argues that knowledge is intertwined with power; it shapes our understanding of truth and reality. The entities that control knowledge—be they corporations or tech giants—dictate what is considered valid, often limiting individual autonomy and genuine understanding. This dynamic is especially relevant in the digital age, where information is commodified and easily manipulated.\n\n\n## 3. The Narrative of *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*\n### 3.1 Technological Augmentation vs. Authenticity\nIn *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, we follow **David Martinez**, a character whose struggle for identity reflects the conflict between **technological enhancement** and the loss of humanity. As he adopts cybernetic modifications, he faces the paradox of becoming more powerful while simultaneously losing his authentic self. This mirrors the broader societal trend where technology offers convenience at the expense of genuine identity.\n\n### 3.2 Emotional Superficiality\nThe series poignantly illustrates how relationships are affected in a commodified world. As characters increasingly rely on AI-generated interactions, the **devaluation** of genuine emotional connections becomes apparent. The once-vibrant act of expressing love is overshadowed by artificial constructs, rendering human emotions less meaningful.\n\n\n## 4. The Pessimistic Outlook: A Cultural Decline\n### 4.1 Erosion of Authentic Experiences\nAs reliance on technology and AI grows, we witness an erosion of **authentic experiences**. The convenience of digital communication often leads to superficial engagements that lack depth and emotional resonance. This shift poses a threat to the richness of human interactions.\n\n### 4.2 The Future of Human Relationships\nSpeculating on a future dominated by technology, we may find ourselves in a world where emotional expressions are reduced to mere algorithms. The implications are troubling: the fabric of human relationships could unravel, as genuine connections are replaced by calculated responses.\n\n### 4.3 The Risk of Relativism\nFinally, the pervasive influence of technology raises concerns about the loss of **objective truths** and values. In a society increasingly driven by individual narratives shaped by algorithms, we risk fostering a relativistic worldview where meaning and morality become fluid concepts, further complicating our understanding of humanity.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\nReflecting on humanity’s trajectory, we must grapple with the implications of technology on our understanding of self and others. As we navigate this landscape, it is crucial to seek authentic connections and critically examine the influence of technology on our lives. In doing so, we can strive to preserve the essence of our humanity amidst the encroaching shadows of commodification and emotional devaluation. \n\nIn an age where technology has the potential to inspire emotions better than we can, the challenge remains: how do we reclaim the value of authentic human expression?\n\n\n> \"From the idea that the self is not given to us, I think there is only one practical consequence: we have to create ourselves as a work of art.\" - Foucault\n\n","source":"_posts/The-Devaluation-of-Humanity.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Devaluation of Humanity in the Age of Technology\ndate: 2024-09-27 22:20:15\ntags: [recommended, philosophy, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, anime]\ncategories: thought\n---\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20240927222641.png> \"a\")\n\n## 1.

In this blog, I want to discuss the fragility of imposed purpose and the significance of existence.\n\n**Spoiler alert.**\n\n## Plot Overview\n\n*Nier: Automata* is an action role-playing game released in 2017, developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. The game is set in a future where humans have fled to the moon after an invasion by alien machines. The YorHa project is launched to reclaim Earth, with androids like 2B, 9S, and A2 fighting for \"the glory of mankind.\" These androids undergo countless battles, sacrificing everything for their assigned purpose. However, they eventually learn that humanity is already extinct, rendering their mission—and their entire existence—a meaningless lie.\n\n## Lost Purpose, Broken Core\n\nWhen the truth is revealed—that their purpose was fabricated to perpetuate a lie—the androids react in different ways, each struggling to cope.\n\nA2 was the sole survivor of her unit in battle against the machines. According to her former partner Anemone, A2 was once hopeful despite the worsening reality. Upon learning the truth, A2 chose to betray YorHa, fighting the machines to fill her emptiness and hatred. She found some hope again after forming friendships in Pascal's village, but when the village was destroyed by other machines, it broke her. From then on, her sole purpose was to destroy all machines.\n\n9S, a scanning unit, accidentally discovered the truth in the Bunker's server. His love for 2B helped him endure, but when he witnessed A2 kill 2B—who was infected by the logic virus—his purpose vanished completely. Consumed by agony, he unleashed relentless violence on the machines, showing no mercy. In the resource gathering unit, he executed an unarmed machine core without hesitation. His psychological state deteriorated through battle after battle, culminating in madness during endings C and D: \"Hahahaha, we are just perpetuators of lies! You killed 2B, and that is enough for me to kill you!\"\n\nThe loss of purpose ultimately led to the loss of self. All endings of the game lead to the death of the main characters (\"No blackbox signal detected\"), representing their physical and mental demise.\n\n## Resilience and Rebellion\n\nDespite losing everything, the characters display resilience. Even as their physical bodies fail and their memories and logic fade, they bear the will to exist, even if it means defying the world.\n\nAfter the deaths of A2 and 9S, their will resonates with the PODs, which decide to reject the mission to delete all YorHa data. This rejection represents a defiance against the entire system—a rebellion akin to a lone leaf against an ocean. The game symbolizes this by letting the player \"hack\" against the credit list (representing the world), making the rebellion gradually impossible by adding more barrages and mobs. This scene illustrates the ultimate struggle for existence.\n\nThe law of the world is creation and destruction, and the will to exist is a rebellion against that law. While the rebellion might seem futile, it gives life meaning.\n\nIn the end, the tower does not launch the missile to destroy the human data server on the moon. Instead, it sends an ark into space, carrying the memories of Adam, Eve, 2B, 9S, A2, and many machine lifeforms. It drifts slowly in the universe, with no known destination. \"The ark will find a home for these souls, or just wander in eternity.\" This launch is like a cry in the silent void: \"We exist!\" There is no echo, no destination, but the very act of existing is significant.\n\n## Existentialism: **Jean-Paul Sartre**\n\nJean-Paul Sartre believed that we are not born with an inherent purpose. Instead, meaning must be created through our actions, and the freedom to choose is both liberating and overwhelming. When people cling to false purposes to avoid the weight of this freedom, Sartre called it _bad faith_. The truth often forces us to confront life’s absurdity—the realization that meaning is not given, but made.\n\n*Nier: Automata* captures this struggle vividly. Its androids start with a clear mission—\"glory to mankind\"—but when this purpose is exposed as a lie, they are left to face the void. Their responses to this existential crisis, from 9S's agony to A2's rebellion, reflect Sartre's view of how individuals grapple with freedom and the need to create their own meaning.\n\nDespite being defeated by the hollowness of purposelessness, A2 and 9S still manage to \"carry the weight of the world.\" Their final will results in the PODs’ rejection of their deletion mission, symbolizing existential defiance. Sartre’s philosophy resonates here: rebellion, no matter how futile, affirms the value of existence. Through their choices, the characters prove that life gains significance not through external validation, but through the will to continue despite the absurd.\n\n### Cyber Interview with Sartre\n\n*Prompt: If You Were Jean-Paul Sartre, How Would You Comment on the Game?*\n\n> If I were Jean-Paul Sartre, I would view _NieR: Automata_ as a profound manifestation of existential freedom, choice, and the absurdity of the human (or android) condition. At the heart of Sartre's philosophy is the belief that \"existence precedes essence\"—the idea that we are not born with any inherent purpose or meaning, but instead must create our own. The YorHa androids, created with the singular mission to \"glory to mankind,\" are a perfect illustration of this existential void. They are given a purpose, a fabricated significance, but when that purpose is shattered, they are forced to confront the meaninglessness of their existence. Their suffering is not merely physical, but deeply psychological, as they grapple with the profound realization that their lives have been nothing more than tools in a lie perpetuated by their creators.\n\n## Reflection of Reality\n\nIn reality, although we are not androids tasked with the \"glory of mankind,\" we are often given purposes that we accept without question. Sometimes these purposes benefit us, but sometimes they lead to harm.\n\nOne example is how many children in modern China are given the purpose of achieving good grades. Due to societal and parental expectations, they are not always aware of it or able to resist it. This can lead to academic success for some, but also depression and anxiety for others. Parents, too, may be given the false purpose of ensuring their children get into prestigious universities (like 985 or 211 schools), which can lead to a narrow focus on academics and strain familial relationships. The absurdity of this pressure is explored in the game [Chinese Parents](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736190), where one player noted: \"You still have a chance of getting an offer from Tsinghua University if you don’t teach your child how to walk.\"\n\n*Nier: Automata* is dramatic, with its characters dealing with only a few purposes, unlike the complex goals people have in real life. However, it makes us reflect on our own lives:\n\nWhat kinds of purposes do we have? How many are imposed upon us, and how many do we accept without judgment? What are the consequences of bearing these purposes?\n\nUltimately, the game reminds us that purpose should not be imposed upon us; it should be something we define for ourselves. Like the characters' final defiance against a meaningless existence, we too can rebel against false purposes and strive to create meaning through our choices—however small they may seem.\n","source":"_posts/The-Fragility-of-Purpose-Nier-Automata.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'The Fragility of Purpose: Nier: Automata'\ndate: 2024-12-01 13:36:25\ntags: [recommended, philosophy, Nier Automata, game]\ncategories: thought\n---\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20241201124607.png> \"a\")\n\n# The Fragility of Purpose: _Nier: Automata_\n\n> The hollowness and powerlessness when purpose is given and destroyed.\n\nI never quite realized how fragile purpose can be until I played *Nier: Automata*.

In this blog, I want to discuss the fragility of imposed purpose and the significance of existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Spoiler alert.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"Plot-Overview\"><a href=\"#Plot-Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Plot Overview\"></a>Plot Overview</h2><p><em>Nier: Automata</em> is an action role-playing game released in 2017, developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. The game is set in a future where humans have fled to the moon after an invasion by alien machines. The YorHa project is launched to reclaim Earth, with androids like 2B, 9S, and A2 fighting for “the glory of mankind.” These androids undergo countless battles, sacrificing everything for their assigned purpose. However, they eventually learn that humanity is already extinct, rendering their mission—and their entire existence—a meaningless lie.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Lost-Purpose-Broken-Core\"><a href=\"#Lost-Purpose-Broken-Core\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lost Purpose, Broken Core\"></a>Lost Purpose, Broken Core</h2><p>When the truth is revealed—that their purpose was fabricated to perpetuate a lie—the androids react in different ways, each struggling to cope.</p>\n<p>A2 was the sole survivor of her unit in battle against the machines. According to her former partner Anemone, A2 was once hopeful despite the worsening reality. Upon learning the truth, A2 chose to betray YorHa, fighting the machines to fill her emptiness and hatred. She found some hope again after forming friendships in Pascal’s village, but when the village was destroyed by other machines, it broke her. From then on, her sole purpose was to destroy all machines.</p>\n<p>9S, a scanning unit, accidentally discovered the truth in the Bunker’s server. His love for 2B helped him endure, but when he witnessed A2 kill 2B—who was infected by the logic virus—his purpose vanished completely. Consumed by agony, he unleashed relentless violence on the machines, showing no mercy. In the resource gathering unit, he executed an unarmed machine core without hesitation. His psychological state deteriorated through battle after battle, culminating in madness during endings C and D: “Hahahaha, we are just perpetuators of lies! You killed 2B, and that is enough for me to kill you!”</p>\n<p>The loss of purpose ultimately led to the loss of self. All endings of the game lead to the death of the main characters (“No blackbox signal detected”), representing their physical and mental demise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Resilience-and-Rebellion\"><a href=\"#Resilience-and-Rebellion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Resilience and Rebellion\"></a>Resilience and Rebellion</h2><p>Despite losing everything, the characters display resilience. Even as their physical bodies fail and their memories and logic fade, they bear the will to exist, even if it means defying the world.</p>\n<p>After the deaths of A2 and 9S, their will resonates with the PODs, which decide to reject the mission to delete all YorHa data. This rejection represents a defiance against the entire system—a rebellion akin to a lone leaf against an ocean. The game symbolizes this by letting the player “hack” against the credit list (representing the world), making the rebellion gradually impossible by adding more barrages and mobs. This scene illustrates the ultimate struggle for existence.</p>\n<p>The law of the world is creation and destruction, and the will to exist is a rebellion against that law. While the rebellion might seem futile, it gives life meaning.</p>\n<p>In the end, the tower does not launch the missile to destroy the human data server on the moon. Instead, it sends an ark into space, carrying the memories of Adam, Eve, 2B, 9S, A2, and many machine lifeforms. It drifts slowly in the universe, with no known destination. “The ark will find a home for these souls, or just wander in eternity.” This launch is like a cry in the silent void: “We exist!” There is no echo, no destination, but the very act of existing is significant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Existentialism-Jean-Paul-Sartre\"><a href=\"#Existentialism-Jean-Paul-Sartre\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre\"></a>Existentialism: <strong>Jean-Paul Sartre</strong></h2><p>Jean-Paul Sartre believed that we are not born with an inherent purpose. Instead, meaning must be created through our actions, and the freedom to choose is both liberating and overwhelming. When people cling to false purposes to avoid the weight of this freedom, Sartre called it <em>bad faith</em>. The truth often forces us to confront life’s absurdity—the realization that meaning is not given, but made.</p>\n<p><em>Nier: Automata</em> captures this struggle vividly. Its androids start with a clear mission—“glory to mankind”—but when this purpose is exposed as a lie, they are left to face the void. Their responses to this existential crisis, from 9S’s agony to A2’s rebellion, reflect Sartre’s view of how individuals grapple with freedom and the need to create their own meaning.</p>\n<p>Despite being defeated by the hollowness of purposelessness, A2 and 9S still manage to “carry the weight of the world.” Their final will results in the PODs’ rejection of their deletion mission, symbolizing existential defiance. Sartre’s philosophy resonates here: rebellion, no matter how futile, affirms the value of existence. Through their choices, the characters prove that life gains significance not through external validation, but through the will to continue despite the absurd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Cyber-Interview-with-Sartre\"><a href=\"#Cyber-Interview-with-Sartre\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cyber Interview with Sartre\"></a>Cyber Interview with Sartre</h3><p><em>Prompt: If You Were Jean-Paul Sartre, How Would You Comment on the Game?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I were Jean-Paul Sartre, I would view <em>NieR: Automata</em> as a profound manifestation of existential freedom, choice, and the absurdity of the human (or android) condition. At the heart of Sartre’s philosophy is the belief that “existence precedes essence”—the idea that we are not born with any inherent purpose or meaning, but instead must create our own. The YorHa androids, created with the singular mission to “glory to mankind,” are a perfect illustration of this existential void. They are given a purpose, a fabricated significance, but when that purpose is shattered, they are forced to confront the meaninglessness of their existence. Their suffering is not merely physical, but deeply psychological, as they grapple with the profound realization that their lives have been nothing more than tools in a lie perpetuated by their creators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Reflection-of-Reality\"><a href=\"#Reflection-of-Reality\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Reflection of Reality\"></a>Reflection of Reality</h2><p>In reality, although we are not androids tasked with the “glory of mankind,” we are often given purposes that we accept without question. Sometimes these purposes benefit us, but sometimes they lead to harm.</p>\n<p>One example is how many children in modern China are given the purpose of achieving good grades. Due to societal and parental expectations, they are not always aware of it or able to resist it. This can lead to academic success for some, but also depression and anxiety for others. Parents, too, may be given the false purpose of ensuring their children get into prestigious universities (like 985 or 211 schools), which can lead to a narrow focus on academics and strain familial relationships. The absurdity of this pressure is explored in the game <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/736190\">Chinese Parents</a>, where one player noted: “You still have a chance of getting an offer from Tsinghua University if you don’t teach your child how to walk.”</p>\n<p><em>Nier: Automata</em> is dramatic, with its characters dealing with only a few purposes, unlike the complex goals people have in real life. However, it makes us reflect on our own lives:</p>\n<p>What kinds of purposes do we have? How many are imposed upon us, and how many do we accept without judgment? What are the consequences of bearing these purposes?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the game reminds us that purpose should not be imposed upon us; it should be something we define for ourselves. Like the characters’ final defiance against a meaningless existence, we too can rebel against false purposes and strive to create meaning through our choices—however small they may seem.</p>\n"},{"title":"ancient Egyptian birds in Shanghai Museum","date":"2024-11-06T15:37:34.000Z","_content":"\n# Observe Ancient Egyptian Birds in Shanghai Museum\n\nThe Nile River's fertile plains created an environment teeming with avian life, making birds an integral part of the Egyptians' spiritual and material world.

Built iron.cs-csc.online","date":"2024-11-02T12:27:36.000Z","_content":"\n# How I Built iron.cs-csc.online\n\n## Introduction: Purpose and Main Function\n\nInspired by [财神猫猫](https://space.bilibili.com/439176875)'s live stream featuring the sound of an iron pole dropping, I decided to build a similar platform for my own enjoyment. While the original stream had functions such as triggering an iron pole drop sound, playing meme sounds upon entering, and using dynamic colors, [iron.cs-csc.online](http://iron.cs-csc.online) is more like a song request system where memes play upon clients' commands. Additionally, clients can interrupt the current meme with the powerful `drop` command.\n\n## The Overall Structure\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/flowchart iron.png> \"a\")\n\nThree main components make up this meme-streaming system:\n\n1. **Storage Bucket**: This is where the meme sound files are stored, using a Tencent COS bucket.\n2. **Frontend**: The user interface (UI) that sends client commands, displays other clients' messages, plays meme sounds, and reacts to the `drop` command, built with `React.js`.\n3. **API**: An API that connects clients with the storage bucket and frontend, broadcasting messages to all clients and translating commands into URLs for the storage bucket, based on `Python FastAPI WebSocket`.\n\n### Storage Bucket\n\nThe bucket is for storing and retrieving data. The basic setup involves creating a bucket with [Tencent COS bucket](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/products/cos), selecting a region outside mainland China (to avoid registration requirements). After that, you simply upload your sound files, and you're all set. More details can be found in the official documentation. The sound files I used are from [SoundEffectsArchive](https://github.com/Schutzecute/SoundEffectsArchive).\n\nFor additional security, I recommend using your own domain instead of the one provided by Tencent COS.\n\n### API\n\nThere are numerous ways to build an API, but `FastAPI` was my choice for its simplicity.\n\nTo connect with the COS bucket, you’ll need the `coscmd` library from Tencent. Follow the [official documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10976) to configure `CosConfig` with the basic domain configuration method.\n\nThe process of handling client messages and broadcasting them:\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20241102162325.png> \"a\")\n\n### Frontend\n\nThe app connects to a WebSocket server to receive and send chat messages in real-time. Users can send messages with meme names or `drop` commands, triggering the 'iron pole drop' effect. The app displays the latest 10 messages in a chat component. When a meme message is received, the meme name appears as a pop-up, and the associated sound plays briefly. User inputs are limited to 50 characters, and there’s a 1.5-second interval between messages to prevent spamming.\n\n## Implementation Details and Deployment\n\nThe link to the repo: [gugu-py/iron-pipe-open](https://github.com/gugu-py/iron-pipe-open). Feel free to check out the code.\n\nFor the API, I deployed it on a [Tencent Lighthouse](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1207) instance for 45 RMB/month.

Additionally, clients can interrupt the current meme with the powerful `drop` command.\n\n## The Overall Structure\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/flowchart iron.png> \"a\")\n\nThree main components make up this meme-streaming system:\n\n1. **Storage Bucket**: This is where the meme sound files are stored, using a Tencent COS bucket.\n2. **Frontend**: The user interface (UI) that sends client commands, displays other clients' messages, plays meme sounds, and reacts to the `drop` command, built with `React.js`.\n3. **API**: An API that connects clients with the storage bucket and frontend, broadcasting messages to all clients and translating commands into URLs for the storage bucket, based on `Python FastAPI WebSocket`.\n\n### Storage Bucket\n\nThe bucket is for storing and retrieving data. The basic setup involves creating a bucket with [Tencent COS bucket](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/products/cos), selecting a region outside mainland China (to avoid registration requirements). After that, you simply upload your sound files, and you're all set. More details can be found in the official documentation. The sound files I used are from [SoundEffectsArchive](https://github.com/Schutzecute/SoundEffectsArchive).\n\nFor additional security, I recommend using your own domain instead of the one provided by Tencent COS.\n\n### API\n\nThere are numerous ways to build an API, but `FastAPI` was my choice for its simplicity.\n\nTo connect with the COS bucket, you’ll need the `coscmd` library from Tencent. Follow the [official documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10976) to configure `CosConfig` with the basic domain configuration method.\n\nThe process of handling client messages and broadcasting them:\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20241102162325.png> \"a\")\n\n### Frontend\n\nThe app connects to a WebSocket server to receive and send chat messages in real-time. Users can send messages with meme names or `drop` commands, triggering the 'iron pole drop' effect. The app displays the latest 10 messages in a chat component. When a meme message is received, the meme name appears as a pop-up, and the associated sound plays briefly. User inputs are limited to 50 characters, and there’s a 1.5-second interval between messages to prevent spamming.\n\n## Implementation Details and Deployment\n\nThe link to the repo: [gugu-py/iron-pipe-open](https://github.com/gugu-py/iron-pipe-open). Feel free to check out the code.\n\nFor the API, I deployed it on a [Tencent Lighthouse](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1207) instance for 45 RMB/month. The frontend is hosted on Tencent COS bucket alongside the sound files, costing around 1 RMB per month, depending on the data transfer rate.\n\n## Possible Improvements\n\nFuture expansions include adding more sound files.\n\nAdditionally, a SQL database could be used to manage the sound files and names more effectively for an improved command experience. ~~The absence of this isn’t due to a lack of skill.~~\n\n> Special thanks to 财神猫猫 for providing guidance and encourage me to complete this project.\n","slug":"iron-re","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.539Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44z60034slij2stzgm20","content":"<h1 id=\"How-I-Built-iron-cs-csc-online\"><a href=\"#How-I-Built-iron-cs-csc-online\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How I Built iron.cs-csc.online\"></a>How I Built iron.cs-csc.online</h1><h2 id=\"Introduction-Purpose-and-Main-Function\"><a href=\"#Introduction-Purpose-and-Main-Function\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction: Purpose and Main Function\"></a>Introduction: Purpose and Main Function</h2><p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://space.bilibili.com/439176875\">财神猫猫</a>‘s live stream featuring the sound of an iron pole dropping, I decided to build a similar platform for my own enjoyment.

https://blog.csdn.net/u010281174/article/details/97498647\n\n## 爬虫检测方法总结\n\n最新推荐文章于 2023-07-24 16:09:11 发布\n\n版权声明：本文为博主原创文章，遵循 [CC 4.0 BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) 版权协议，转载请附上原文出处链接和本声明。\n\n## 背景\n\n近期由于工作上的需求，研究了一下反[爬虫](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=%E7%88%AC%E8%99%AB&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020)的工作。爬虫真是一种让人又爱又恨的存在，一方面搜索引擎的爬虫可以带来更多曝光率和更多流量，对公司是一件好事，但是也有一些个人或者竞争对手的爬虫，不但不会带来利润，反而会像DDos一样对服务器造成压力。\n\n反爬虫一般存在于两个环节，一种是traffic层面，在爬虫访问到服务器之前进行识别、区分，减轻服务器的压力，一般[CDN](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=CDN&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020)提供商会有相关的反爬虫服务可以购买；一种是在统计层面，防止爬虫对流量、性能分析的影响。这篇文章主要讨论统计层面的反爬虫。\n\n## 日志！日志！\n\n既然是统计层面，那么前端的日志必不可少。对每一条请求的日志，至少要包含\n\n-   user-agent，即ua，提供浏览器、系统等信息\n    \n-   bev\\_id，与设备/浏览器相关，可以认为每个设备的bev\\_id都是独一无二的\n    \n-   ip，记录请求的ip地址\n    \n-   url，即该请求访问的网址\n    \n-   user\\_id，对可以登录的网站，该条目记录登录信息\n    \n-   timestamps，记录时间戳，精确到秒或毫秒\n    \n\n除此之外，最好还包含：\n\n-   用户行为记录，比如该条request是搜索、登录、浏览信息还是支付等等。\n    \n\n另外由于日志的解析问题，可能会有一些日志比较奇怪。如果这种奇怪的日志数量较大，那么首先应该提高数据的质量，才能考虑后续的去爬虫。\n\n## 爬虫特征\n\n对爬虫的检测有好几种方法。但是问题在于，没有一种方法能保证不误伤真实用户，也不能保证完全检测出所有爬虫。这是因为理论上说，爬虫总是可以模仿真实用户，ua可以模拟，访问频率时间也可以模拟，甚至ip也可以申请多个来回切换。模拟的越真实，越难识别，但是相应的代价（金钱开销，时间成本，代码复杂度）也越高。因此一般爬虫不会用这么多复杂手段来反爬虫。常用的爬虫伪装手段都有：\n\n基础手段：\n\n-   模拟真实用户的ua。一般用脚本写http访问，脚本会默认用自己的ua，这样反爬虫的时候很容易识别；好在脚本也支持自定义ua，如果爬虫采用了浏览器的ua，伪装成浏览器，就不容易被识别出来。\n    \n\n进阶手段：\n\n-   使用多个ua/bev\\_id，打乱并随机采用\n    \n-   分布式，将爬虫部署在多个机器上，采用不同的ip爬取数据\n    \n-   模拟用户登录行为，在cookie里带入真实用户的登录信息\n    \n-   继上一条，记录多个用户cookie，打乱并随机采用\n    \n\n丧心病狂手段：\n\n-   解析js，模拟用户行为，比如点击、发送日志等\n    \n-   模拟用户浏览的行为，比如一天24小时以均匀速度访问网页的肯定不是正常人类行为；只大量访问数据页面没经过主页、搜索页面的大概率不是人类行为\n    \n\n所以说，爬虫检测真的是很麻烦的事情。\n\n## 处理方法\n\n针对爬虫的各种伪装，检测手段如下。\n\n基础手段：\n\n-   ua黑名单，分出自我标识的“善良的”爬虫\n\n基于ua/bev\\_id/ip的统计手段：\n\n-   ua行为检测，同一个ua下不同bev\\_id的访问次数，如果这个平均次数接近于1，意味着这是打乱bev\\_id但是没有打乱ua的爬虫\n    \n-   可疑的ip，如果某个ip的所有请求中，有大量不同的bev\\_id但是几乎没有登录用户（user\\_id），或者大量bev\\_id的访问时间很短，则认为这个ip可疑\n    \n-   打乱ip，如果一个bev\\_id的访问量过大，而且该bev\\_id对应的ip值很多，则说明该bev\\_id采用了打乱ip的方法，较可能为爬虫\n    \n\n基于用户行为\n\n-   某个bev\\_id的所有访问集中在某几个/几类网页，则可能是爬虫\n    \n\n以上列出的都是些比较通用的方法。对于特定的网站，可能有一些特定的方法可以做进一步的爬虫检测。实际应用来看，上面的方法已经可以检测出较大比例的爬虫。\n\n## Ground-truth选取\n\n爬虫检测的一大困难在于，没有一个真值可以作为参考。就像机器学习里面的无监督学习。上面列的所有的特征、规则都是基于经验的，就算一个请求被标记为爬虫，哪怕概率再高，我们也无法保证它真的是爬虫。\n\n但是在实际应用中，还是可以有一些洞见可以为爬虫检测提供一些指引。这些洞见是基于爬虫和真实人类行为之间的差异，例如对携程来说，它的网站提供的是酒店、行程的预定，爬虫显然是不会下单付款的，而真实用户有较大的可能性会付款。那么基于这样的一个事实，可以构建一个“肯定是真实用户”的列表，如果某个bev\\_id被标记为爬虫，但是最终这个bev\\_id对应的用户付款了，那么相应的检测规则就有必要重新考量一下了。类似的情况在不同的网站不同的场景会有所不同，但出发点都是一样的——寻找爬虫与真实用户的不同。\n\n## 后记\n\n虽然前面列出的规则看起来都比较显而易见，但是想应用得好还得根据具体问题具体分析，设定相关的阈值。比如同一个ua/bev\\_id的访问量，多少算多？阈值的设定最好是基于统计的，即先对网站的数据做一个分析，然后按一定比例设定阈值，比如最大访问量的99%。这些探究过程比较耗时，但也比较有意思，在翻阅数据的时候可能会有一些有意思的发现。\n\n\n","source":"_posts/爬虫检测方法总结-如何识别爬虫行为.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

user\\_id，对可以登录的网站，该条目记录登录信息\n    \n-   timestamps，记录时间戳，精确到秒或毫秒\n    \n\n除此之外，最好还包含：\n\n-   用户行为记录，比如该条request是搜索、登录、浏览信息还是支付等等。\n    \n\n另外由于日志的解析问题，可能会有一些日志比较奇怪。如果这种奇怪的日志数量较大，那么首先应该提高数据的质量，才能考虑后续的去爬虫。\n\n## 爬虫特征\n\n对爬虫的检测有好几种方法。但是问题在于，没有一种方法能保证不误伤真实用户，也不能保证完全检测出所有爬虫。这是因为理论上说，爬虫总是可以模仿真实用户，ua可以模拟，访问频率时间也可以模拟，甚至ip也可以申请多个来回切换。模拟的越真实，越难识别，但是相应的代价（金钱开销，时间成本，代码复杂度）也越高。因此一般爬虫不会用这么多复杂手段来反爬虫。常用的爬虫伪装手段都有：\n\n基础手段：\n\n-   模拟真实用户的ua。一般用脚本写http访问，脚本会默认用自己的ua，这样反爬虫的时候很容易识别；好在脚本也支持自定义ua，如果爬虫采用了浏览器的ua，伪装成浏览器，就不容易被识别出来。\n    \n\n进阶手段：\n\n-   使用多个ua/bev\\_id，打乱并随机采用\n    \n-   分布式，将爬虫部署在多个机器上，采用不同的ip爬取数据\n    \n-   模拟用户登录行为，在cookie里带入真实用户的登录信息\n    \n-   继上一条，记录多个用户cookie，打乱并随机采用\n    \n\n丧心病狂手段：\n\n-   解析js，模拟用户行为，比如点击、发送日志等\n    \n-   模拟用户浏览的行为，比如一天24小时以均匀速度访问网页的肯定不是正常人类行为；只大量访问数据页面没经过主页、搜索页面的大概率不是人类行为\n    \n\n所以说，爬虫检测真的是很麻烦的事情。\n\n## 处理方法\n\n针对爬虫的各种伪装，检测手段如下。\n\n基础手段：\n\n-   ua黑名单，分出自我标识的“善良的”爬虫\n\n基于ua/bev\\_id/ip的统计手段：\n\n-   ua行为检测，同一个ua下不同bev\\_id的访问次数，如果这个平均次数接近于1，意味着这是打乱bev\\_id但是没有打乱ua的爬虫\n    \n-   可疑的ip，如果某个ip的所有请求中，有大量不同的bev\\_id但是几乎没有登录用户（user\\_id），或者大量bev\\_id的访问时间很短，则认为这个ip可疑\n    \n-   打乱ip，如果一个bev\\_id的访问量过大，而且该bev\\_id对应的ip值很多，则说明该bev\\_id采用了打乱ip的方法，较可能为爬虫\n    \n\n基于用户行为\n\n-   某个bev\\_id的所有访问集中在某几个/几类网页，则可能是爬虫\n    \n\n以上列出的都是些比较通用的方法。对于特定的网站，可能有一些特定的方法可以做进一步的爬虫检测。实际应用来看，上面的方法已经可以检测出较大比例的爬虫。\n\n## Ground-truth选取\n\n爬虫检测的一大困难在于，没有一个真值可以作为参考。就像机器学习里面的无监督学习。上面列的所有的特征、规则都是基于经验的，就算一个请求被标记为爬虫，哪怕概率再高，我们也无法保证它真的是爬虫。\n\n但是在实际应用中，还是可以有一些洞见可以为爬虫检测提供一些指引。这些洞见是基于爬虫和真实人类行为之间的差异，例如对携程来说，它的网站提供的是酒店、行程的预定，爬虫显然是不会下单付款的，而真实用户有较大的可能性会付款。那么基于这样的一个事实，可以构建一个“肯定是真实用户”的列表，如果某个bev\\_id被标记为爬虫，但是最终这个bev\\_id对应的用户付款了，那么相应的检测规则就有必要重新考量一下了。类似的情况在不同的网站不同的场景会有所不同，但出发点都是一样的——寻找爬虫与真实用户的不同。\n\n## 后记\n\n虽然前面列出的规则看起来都比较显而易见，但是想应用得好还得根据具体问题具体分析，设定相关的阈值。比如同一个ua/bev\\_id的访问量，多少算多？阈值的设定最好是基于统计的，即先对网站的数据做一个分析，然后按一定比例设定阈值，比如最大访问量的99%。这些探究过程比较耗时，但也比较有意思，在翻阅数据的时候可能会有一些有意思的发现。\n\n\n","slug":"爬虫检测方法总结-如何识别爬虫行为","published":1,"updated":"2025-02-13T15:08:31.539Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm73i44zw0064slij6ck3bp5z","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><a

xlrd.open_workbook('excelFile.xls') # 打开Excel文件读取数据\n\n# 获取sheet\nthe_sheet = data.sheets()[0]              # 通过索引顺序获取（0是第一个sheet） \nthe_sheet = data.sheet_by_index(0)        # 通过索引顺序获取，同上 \nthe_sheet = data.sheet_by_name(u'Sheet1') # 通过名称获取\n\n# 获取数据，返回值为list\ndata_list.row_values(1) # 第二行数据（支持负索引取值）\ndata_list.col_values(1) # 第二列数据\n\n# 获得行数和列数。\nrows = the_sheet.nrows # 行数\ncols = the_sheet.ncols # 列数\n# 输出每一行数据\nfor i in range(rows):\n    print(the_sheet.row_values(i))\n\n# 获得指定单元格数据的三种方式\ndata = the_sheet.cell(0,0).value # 第一行第一列的值\ndata = the_sheet.row(0)[0].value # 第一行第一列\ndata = the_sheet.col(0)[0].value # 第一列第一行\n\ndata = the_sheet.cell(0,0).xf_index # 第一行第一列的背景色\ndata = the_sheet.row(0)[0].xf_index # 第一行第一列的背景色\ndata = the_sheet.col(0)[0].xf_index # 第一列第一行的背景色\n```\n\n\n\n**修改excel**\n\n\n```\nrow=0 # 修改第一行\ncol=0 # 修改第一列\n\n# ctype: 0-->empty,1-->string,2-->number,3-->date,4-->boolean,5-->error\ncell_type=1 # 修改类型\nvalue='你说你不懂我为何在这时牵手' #

再看一下，值已被改\n```\n\n\n\n**其他**\n\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['JSON_AS_ASCII'] = False\n\n@app.route('/ttt', methods=['POST'])\ndef ttt():\n    filestorage = request.files.get('upload')\n    print(filestorage)\n    f = filestorage.read()\n    workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(file_contents=f)\n    sheet2 =

'ttt'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run( host='0.0.0.0')\n```\n\n在flask中，不经过磁盘IO直接读取前端传的.xls文件\n\n### **xlutils 追写 Excel**\n\n　　xlwt 只能创建一个全新的 Excel 文件，然后对这个文件进行写入内容以及保存。\n\n　　但是大多数情况下需求会是读入一个 Excel 文件，然后进行修改或追加，这个时候，就决定用你了—— xlutils 。\n\n下面的 demo 是给一个 Excel 文件追加内容：\n\n\n```\nfrom xlrd import open_workbook\nfrom xlutils.copy import copy\n\n# 用 xlrd 提供的方法读取一个excel文件\nrexcel = open_workbook(\"ttt.xls\",formatting_info=True) # 保留原有样式\n# 用 xlrd 提供的方法获得现在已有的行数\nrows = rexcel.sheets()[0].nrows \n# 用 xlutils 提供的copy方法将 xlrd 的对象转化为 xlwt 的对象\nexcel = copy(rexcel) \n# 用 xlwt 对象的方法获得要操作的 sheet\ntable = excel.get_sheet(0) \nvalues = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\nrow = rows\nfor value in values:\n    table.write(row, 0, value) # xlwt对象的写方法，参数分别是行、列、值\n    table.write(row, 1, \"haha\")\n    table.write(row, 2, \"lala\")\n    row += 1\nexcel.save(\"ttt.xls\") # xlwt 对象的保存方法，这时便覆盖掉了原来的 Excel\n```\n\n\n### openpyxl 模块\n\n　　openpyxl 模块是一个读写 Excel 2010 文档的 Python 库，不支持更早格式的 Excel，openpyxl 模块支持同时读取和修改Excel文档。\n\n　　openpyxl 模块默认可读可写，若只需要读或者写的功能，可以在 open 时指定 write\\_only 或 read\\_only 为 True\n\n　　openpyxl 模块中有三个不同层次的类，Workbook 是对工作簿的抽象，Worksheet 是对表格的抽象，Cell 是对单元格的抽象，每一个类都包含了许多属性和方法。\n\n注：openpyxl 只能操作 .xlsx，若需要插入图片需要安装 pillow 库\n\n**打开 Excel 文件**\n\n-   **读取已存在的 Excel 文件**\n-   **新建 Excel 工作簿**\n\n\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\n# 打开已有的 .xlsx\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx') # 可读可写\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx', read_only=True) # 只读\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx', write_only=True) # 只写\n\n# 创建一个新的 .xlsx\nwb = openpyxl.Workbook()\n# ...\nwb.save('xxxxxxx.xlsx') # 保存\n```\n\n\n\n**创建 sheet 并写入值**\n\n-   **获取sheet**\n-   **创建sheet**\n-   **删除sheet**\n-   **复制sheet**\n-   **获取sheet的属性：标题、大小、最大行 /

xlrd.open_workbook('excelFile.xls') # 打开Excel文件读取数据\n\n# 获取sheet\nthe_sheet = data.sheets()[0]              # 通过索引顺序获取（0是第一个sheet） \nthe_sheet = data.sheet_by_index(0)        # 通过索引顺序获取，同上 \nthe_sheet = data.sheet_by_name(u'Sheet1') # 通过名称获取\n\n# 获取数据，返回值为list\ndata_list.row_values(1) # 第二行数据（支持负索引取值）\ndata_list.col_values(1) # 第二列数据\n\n# 获得行数和列数。\nrows = the_sheet.nrows # 行数\ncols = the_sheet.ncols # 列数\n# 输出每一行数据\nfor i in range(rows):\n    print(the_sheet.row_values(i))\n\n# 获得指定单元格数据的三种方式\ndata = the_sheet.cell(0,0).value # 第一行第一列的值\ndata = the_sheet.row(0)[0].value # 第一行第一列\ndata = the_sheet.col(0)[0].value # 第一列第一行\n\ndata = the_sheet.cell(0,0).xf_index # 第一行第一列的背景色\ndata = the_sheet.row(0)[0].xf_index # 第一行第一列的背景色\ndata = the_sheet.col(0)[0].xf_index # 第一列第一行的背景色\n```\n\n\n\n**修改excel**\n\n\n```\nrow=0 # 修改第一行\ncol=0 # 修改第一列\n\n# ctype: 0-->empty,1-->string,2-->number,3-->date,4-->boolean,5-->error\ncell_type=1 # 修改类型\nvalue='你说你不懂我为何在这时牵手' #

再看一下，值已被改\n```\n\n\n\n**其他**\n\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['JSON_AS_ASCII'] = False\n\n@app.route('/ttt', methods=['POST'])\ndef ttt():\n    filestorage = request.files.get('upload')\n    print(filestorage)\n    f = filestorage.read()\n    workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(file_contents=f)\n    sheet2 =

'ttt'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run( host='0.0.0.0')\n```\n\n在flask中，不经过磁盘IO直接读取前端传的.xls文件\n\n### **xlutils 追写 Excel**\n\n　　xlwt 只能创建一个全新的 Excel 文件，然后对这个文件进行写入内容以及保存。\n\n　　但是大多数情况下需求会是读入一个 Excel 文件，然后进行修改或追加，这个时候，就决定用你了—— xlutils 。\n\n下面的 demo 是给一个 Excel 文件追加内容：\n\n\n```\nfrom xlrd import open_workbook\nfrom xlutils.copy import copy\n\n# 用 xlrd 提供的方法读取一个excel文件\nrexcel = open_workbook(\"ttt.xls\",formatting_info=True) # 保留原有样式\n# 用 xlrd 提供的方法获得现在已有的行数\nrows = rexcel.sheets()[0].nrows \n# 用 xlutils 提供的copy方法将 xlrd 的对象转化为 xlwt 的对象\nexcel = copy(rexcel) \n# 用 xlwt 对象的方法获得要操作的 sheet\ntable = excel.get_sheet(0) \nvalues = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\nrow = rows\nfor value in values:\n    table.write(row, 0, value) # xlwt对象的写方法，参数分别是行、列、值\n    table.write(row, 1, \"haha\")\n    table.write(row, 2, \"lala\")\n    row += 1\nexcel.save(\"ttt.xls\") # xlwt 对象的保存方法，这时便覆盖掉了原来的 Excel\n```\n\n\n### openpyxl 模块\n\n　　openpyxl 模块是一个读写 Excel 2010 文档的 Python 库，不支持更早格式的 Excel，openpyxl 模块支持同时读取和修改Excel文档。\n\n　　openpyxl 模块默认可读可写，若只需要读或者写的功能，可以在 open 时指定 write\\_only 或 read\\_only 为 True\n\n　　openpyxl 模块中有三个不同层次的类，Workbook 是对工作簿的抽象，Worksheet 是对表格的抽象，Cell 是对单元格的抽象，每一个类都包含了许多属性和方法。\n\n注：openpyxl 只能操作 .xlsx，若需要插入图片需要安装 pillow 库\n\n**打开 Excel 文件**\n\n-   **读取已存在的 Excel 文件**\n-   **新建 Excel 工作簿**\n\n\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\n# 打开已有的 .xlsx\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx') # 可读可写\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx', read_only=True) # 只读\ndata = openpyxl.load_workbook('xxx.xlsx', write_only=True) # 只写\n\n# 创建一个新的 .xlsx\nwb = openpyxl.Workbook()\n# ...\nwb.save('xxxxxxx.xlsx') # 保存\n```\n\n\n\n**创建 sheet 并写入值**\n\n-   **获取sheet**\n-   **创建sheet**\n-   **删除sheet**\n-   **复制sheet**\n-   **获取sheet的属性：标题、大小、最大行 /

Re","date":"2025-03-22T02:46:49.000Z","_content":"\n# How I built archive.cs-csc.online\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250322104422.png> \"a\")\n\n## It all began with a random talk...\n\nIt was a routine supper, but I happened to sit with Joseph, Giulio, and Richard Yiu. During our random conversation, as we were talking about Joseph's role at the *Challenger*, our school newspaper, he told us they were seeking to make a website to display them. I agreed to help him, and a proposal was developed soon.\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250322102929.png> \"a\")\n\nRight after the dinner, I began to work on this project. My knowledge on Flask and MySQL paid off, enabling me to finish the prototype less than 24 hours. I made a brief demonstration to the coreteam. Everyone was astonished by my productivity. Soon a further plan was made, with a friendly and proactive atmosphere set.\n\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/d466f2f80a40bed8901d2190027c806.png> \"a\")\n\n\nWe even met with the principal and the market department of the school to further propagate this project.\n\nThis project is the first most production-ready application I have ever made. Different from previous projects, I spent most of the time on improving the stability and performance instead of developing all different functions.\n\n## Features and Cores\n\n### Overall Design\n\nThe project ends up with 3 parts: Flask as the core unit, MySQL for database, and a seperate service for file proxy.\n\nGiven the moderate expected traffic, I chose Flask for its simplicity, ease of deployment, and proven stability. Although frameworks like FastAPI offer better performance, Flask provided the ideal balance of speed and maintainability for our use case.\n\nFor MySQL, I used it because it was the only database I was good at. MySQL is famous for its enterprise-level stability and simplicity to act with Flask, but it is also infamous for its cost. If given enough time on this project in the future, I will consider to use MongoDB as a better alternative for its flexibility and cost efficiency. (I learnt this database in a new project ClioCard.)\n\nThe reason why I decided to use a seperate file proxy, is to hide the real file blob of the pdf files. The proxy links should expire after a certain amount of time. This would protect the pdf files from unauthorized sharing. Taking account of Flask's synchronous nature, proxying one file will use a whole thread of the web server. This will severely degrade the performance when multiple users are requesting files simultaneously. Therefore, the best approach is to apply a seperate microservice. Because of the proxy unit's simplicity, I used a Cloudflare worker to do the job.\n\n### Database Overview\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250115133012.png> \"a\")\n\nI keep the database setup simple. \n\nThe database consists of four main tables:\n\n1. **Category**: Organizes newspaper issues into categories (`1-to-many` relationship with `newspaper_issue`).\n2. **Newspaper Issue**: Stores issue metadata (e.g., `title`, `author`, `issued_time`), PDF paths, and `view_power` for access control.\n3. **User**: Manages login credentials, roles, and `view_power` to enforce access restrictions.\n4. **Config**: Holds global settings like stopwords for search and \"About\" page content.\n\n**Key Notes**:\n\n- **Relationships**: Categories link to issues; access control uses `view_power` matching between users and issues.\n- **Focus**: Simplicity for scalability, with clear access control and category-based organization.\n\n### Features and notable details\n\n1. User Experience & Navigation\n\n- **Homepage**\n    - Provides a general overview of the application and its purpose.\n- **Archive Viewing**\n    - Seamlessly access and browse archived issues.\n- **Date-based Navigation**\n    - Quickly find issues by specific months or days.\n- **Search Functionality**\n    - Perform efficient keyword-based searches.\n- **Document Viewing**\n    - Easily access full documents or their text content.\n\n2. Content Management\n\n- **About Page Management**\n    - Edit and update the \"About\" section directly from the admin panel.\n- **Category Management**\n    - Add, edit, or remove categories to organize content effectively.\n- **File Uploading**\n    - Upload and manage files or documents with ease.\n- **Issue Management**\n    - Edit or delete specific newspaper issues in the archive.\n- **Stopword Management**\n    - Customize and edit stopwords to improve search results.\n\n3. User Administration & Security\n\n- **User Authentication**\n    - Enable secure login for existing users and registration for new users.\n- **User Management**\n    - Admins can manage user accounts, including adding, updating, or removing users.\n- **Admin Dashboard**\n    - A centralized panel for managing all application features and settings.\n\nHere are some important details:\n\n#### Viewing Issue\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123100319.png> \"a\")\n\nMetadata are displayed nicely with Jinja template, while handling document display required additional effort. These document(pdf) files are stored in a private Google Cloud Storage bucket. When a file is requested, a signed url expiring in `FILE_LINK_EXPIRE_TIME_SEC` seconds will be generated to ensure security.\n\n> I spent nights and days wrestling with Google PDF proxy issue. I even got a little depressed after figuring out the PDF viewer's strict url format. Fortunately, the idea of utilizing Cloudflare proxy as microservice saved my day.\n\nHowever, since the Google PDF viewer does not support file url with `GET` parameters, I deployed a microservice for specifically handling file proxy. When a document is requested, the signed URL is sent to the proxy, which converts it into a parameter-free URL, which is then embedded into the template. When the document page is rendered by the user, the proxy forwards the request to the original signed URL. This approach effectively secures the URLs while ensuring smooth functionality.\n\n#### Searching with fields\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123100629.png> \"a\")\n\nThis is achieved through SQL ORM technology, similar to [core code of Webird](https://blog.gu33gu.asia/2024/07/29/How-I-built-Webird/#Main-Functions). Being different from the core code of webird, the fields are obtained through `GET params`. Since several pages have the same searching form, a standalone template for searching field is reused.\n\n#### Auth and Access Control\n\nConsidering some students deliver some sensitive ideas on the newspaper, we may control the access to the whole database.\n\nLibrary `flask_login` is applied to manage user. I customized the original user model, where I added a column `view_power`. The `view_power` determines the power of the user to access to articles. Each document has its own view power. Only if the user has equal or greater `view_power`, he is able to access to it.\n\nA customizable stopword list is applied to filter searching keywords. This can be modified easily by admin.\n\n#### Admin Panel\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123101857.png> \"a\")\n\nThe panel can only be accessed by admin users, and its portal is only visible to admin in the menu. In this panel, I enable admin user to operate with the database in a friendly manner. It enables the admin to manage any data, including the categories, document itself, stopwords, and about (markdown). It even allows admin to add, delete, and manage the users, including their username, password, view power.\n\nThis section will introduce several notable details of some functions.\n\n##### Upload\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123105737.png> \"a\")\n\nAdmin can simply fill in the form to complete an upload.\n\nThe uploaded pdf's text is extracted directly (not OCR) to ensure simplicity, using `pdfplumber`. Data type `Long text` is applied to store the text in the db. The file is uploaded to the Google storage.\n\n##### Manage User\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123110145.png> \"a\")\n\nUsers can be managed on the page.\n\nThe backend makesure the admin cannot change its own name or password to improve maintainbility.\n\n### Cache Optimization\n\nEverything requiring db quests are cached to enhance performance and reduce cost. `flask_caching` is applied.\n\nEvery operation of questing db is written as standalone function with cache decorators. Example:\n\n```Python\n@cache.cached(key_prefix=\"get_archive\", timeout=86400)\ndef get_archive() -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves a list of newspaper issues that the current user has permission to view,\n    ordered by issued time in descending order.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of `NewspaperIssue` objects that the current user can view.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Query for issues the current user can view\n    issues = NewspaperIssue.query.filter(\n        NewspaperIssue.view_power <= current_user.view_power\n    ).order_by(NewspaperIssue.issued_time.desc()).all()\n    \n    return issues\n```\n\nEverytime admin modifies document data through admin panel, cache are deleted by calling:\n\n```python\ndef update_cache(modified_issue: NewspaperIssue) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Updates the application cache to ensure consistency after a newspaper issue is modified.\n\n    This function invalidates cache entries that might be affected by changes to the \n    given issue, ensuring stale data is removed. Specifically, it clears cached results for:\n    - Issue retrieval by ID, date ranges, and specific time intervals (year, month, day).\n    - Functions retrieving the archive or related metadata like issue date intervals.\n    - Category-related functions to reflect potential changes in categorization.\n\n    Args:\n        modified_issue (NewspaperIssue): The newspaper issue object that was modified.\n\n    Cache Entries Invalidated:\n        - `get_issue_date_interval`: Clears the date range cache.\n        - `get_archive`: Clears the entire archive cache.\n        - `get_issue`: Clears the cache for the specific issue by ID.\n        - `get_year_month_issues`: Clears cached issues for the issue's year and month.\n        - `get_day_issues`: Clears cached issues for the issue's specific day.\n        - `get_all_category`: Clears category-related caches in case of category updates.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    cache.delete('get_issue_date_interval')\n    cache.delete('get_archive')\n    cache.delete_memoized(get_issue, modified_issue.id)\n    cache.delete_memoized(\n        get_year_month_issues,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.year,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.month\n    )\n    cache.delete_memoized(\n        get_day_issues,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.year,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.month,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.day\n    )\n    cache.delete('get_all_category')\n```\n\nThe only problem here is the `timeout` param in the decorator. You get error when using `current_app.config` to obtain expiring time. \n\nsee more information about cache in official document:  [Flask-Caching — Flask-Caching 1.0.0 documentation](https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\n### Database Initialization\n\nRemember to set `auto_increment=True` for `id` column in your models.\n\nBecause of the usage of searching in `LongText` in MySQL, we need to `add fulltext index`. The app factory is written like below:\n\n```python\n    # Initializes the database, creates tables, and ensures default records exist.\n    from .models import Config as db_Config, Category  # Import your Config model\n    from .utils import ini_users  # Assuming ini_users is in utils.py\n    # print(\"ini0!!!\")\n    with app.app_context():\n        db.create_all()  # Create all tables if they don't already exist\n        \n        # Ensure there is at least one Config record\n        if not db_Config.query.first():\n            default_config = db_Config(stopwords='')\n            db.session.add(default_config)\n            db.session.commit()\n        Category.get_or_create_default()\n        # Initialize default users or other essential data\n        ini_users()\n        try:\n            sql = text('ALTER TABLE newspaper_issue ADD FULLTEXT INDEX idx_fulltext_content (content);')\n            result = db.session.execute(sql)\n        except:\n            pass\n\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Web Service\n\nOn google cloud run. Docker build. Nice and simple.\n\nThe domain does not work at first, if you integrate it directly with the cloud run service. A Cloudflare worker is applied to proxy the default url.\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n    // The target Cloud Run URL\n    const targetUrl = 'https://cloud_run.url';\n    \n    // Construct the new URL by appending the requested path and query\n    const url = new URL(request.url);\n    const target = new URL(targetUrl);\n    target.pathname = url.pathname;\n    target.search = url.search;\n\n    // Create a request object with the original headers, pointing to the new target URL\n    const proxyRequest = new Request(target.toString(), request);\n    \n    // Fetch the response from the Cloud Run service\n    const response = await fetch(proxyRequest);\n\n    // Return the response, passing through the headers and status from Cloud Run\n    return new Response(response.body, response);\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\n### Database\n\nGoogle SQL database. Most of the fee comes from here. \n\nSince this project will not serve great traffic, a shared CPU is selected to reduce fee.\n\nThe access should remain private, with specific ip address. Do NOT use `0.0.0.0` to expose it to public. The database is accessed through a socket URI like this in production: \n```Python\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = \"mysql+pymysql://username:password@/database_name?unix_socket=/cloudsql/project-id:region:instance-name\"\n```\n\n### File Proxy Service\n\nCloudflare worker + KV database. Completely free.\n\n1. **Create a Cloudflare Worker**:\n    \n    - Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and create a worker.\n2. **Setup KV Namespace**:\n    \n    - Under \"Workers,\" go to \"KV\" → \"Create Namespace\" → Name it (e.g., `TEMP_LINKS`).\n3. **Connect KV in worker configuration**:\n    \n\t- Under \"Settings\" -> \"Domains & Routes\" -> \"Bindings\":\n\t- ![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123114652.png> \"a\")\n    \n4. **Write the Worker Code**: plug in the proxy code: [link to Gist](https://gist.github.com/gugu-py/bc2054831abaf9e57f47d71cb4c44e3f)\n    \n5. **Deploy**\n\n## Collaboration and Lessons Learned\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/b3e1ac0a958b09e402f1f01c92e66670 1.jpg> \"a\")\n\n> \"Just test this one more feature, please!\" Their enthusiasm kept me motivated.\n\nI would like to appreciate the effort of members (Giulio and Joseph, on two sides of the image) from the Challenger. Although being busy, they are still willing to spend time on pushing the project forward. These were what we did to make this project progress smooth and productive.\n\n**Small team.** Smaller team is best for communication. There is only one developer for the project, so the code style is consistent.\n\n**Spark passion.** Through multiple face-to-face meetings and random talks, the team resulted in a proactive atmosphere. We were able to develop the blueprint and feature list of the application in a few days.\n\n**Regular Report.** The regular report of development progress not only contributes to the proactive and productive atmosphere, but also enabled new features to be tested in no time by non-tech members.\n\nHowever, despite being productive and efficient most of the time, there were some incidents that greatly degraded the progress of project. Here is one lesson learnt.\n\n**Instruct with greater care.** When one (especially non-tech) is prompted to do something unfamiliar, their proactivity will be severely impacted, and thus cause considerable delay in work. This happens when I let the Challenger coreteam member to tryout the upload panel, he misunderstood the task and thought it would involve coding. This caused the task be delayed for at least 2 weeks. After a face to face demonstration of the user-friendly admin panel, the testing is finished in no time.\n\n## Future\n\nThere will be more customization features, such as:\n- color pallete\n- background image\n\nAlso, there should be mechanism to allow reset admin's password. I would like to migrate MySQL to MongoDB to reduce cost.\n\nIf having some time, I want to reconstruct the whole project, using FastAPI + Vue.js to make it more modern.\n\nThere are a lot to do to enhance its tech stack, but the most critical and most difficult thing is future maintainance. I want this archive to outlast my time at school, becoming a legacy for future generations of _The Challenger_. That's why finding someone passionate enough to maintain it after I graduate feels so crucial.\n\n> Creating _archive.cs-csc.online_ taught me not only about web development, but also about conversations and perseverance. It reminded me why I love coding—turning small conversations into tangible, meaningful tools for our community.\n\n","source":"_posts/CSC-Archive-Re.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CSC Archive Re\ndate: 2025-03-22 10:46:49\ntags: [Python, Flask, website, Re, recommended]\ncategories: code\n---\n\n# How I built archive.cs-csc.online\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250322104422.png> \"a\")\n\n## It all began with a random talk...\n\nIt was a routine supper, but I happened to sit with Joseph, Giulio, and Richard Yiu.

Because of the proxy unit's simplicity, I used a Cloudflare worker to do the job.\n\n### Database Overview\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250115133012.png> \"a\")\n\nI keep the database setup simple. \n\nThe database consists of four main tables:\n\n1. **Category**: Organizes newspaper issues into categories (`1-to-many` relationship with `newspaper_issue`).\n2. **Newspaper Issue**: Stores issue metadata (e.g., `title`, `author`, `issued_time`), PDF paths, and `view_power` for access control.\n3. **User**: Manages login credentials, roles, and `view_power` to enforce access restrictions.\n4. **Config**: Holds global settings like stopwords for search and \"About\" page content.\n\n**Key Notes**:\n\n- **Relationships**: Categories link to issues; access control uses `view_power` matching between users and issues.\n- **Focus**: Simplicity for scalability, with clear access control and category-based organization.\n\n### Features and notable details\n\n1. User Experience & Navigation\n\n- **Homepage**\n    - Provides a general overview of the application and its purpose.\n- **Archive Viewing**\n    - Seamlessly access and browse archived issues.\n- **Date-based Navigation**\n    - Quickly find issues by specific months or days.\n- **Search Functionality**\n    - Perform efficient keyword-based searches.\n- **Document Viewing**\n    - Easily access full documents or their text content.\n\n2. Content Management\n\n- **About Page Management**\n    - Edit and update the \"About\" section directly from the admin panel.\n- **Category Management**\n    - Add, edit, or remove categories to organize content effectively.\n- **File Uploading**\n    - Upload and manage files or documents with ease.\n- **Issue Management**\n    - Edit or delete specific newspaper issues in the archive.\n- **Stopword Management**\n    - Customize and edit stopwords to improve search results.\n\n3. User Administration & Security\n\n- **User Authentication**\n    - Enable secure login for existing users and registration for new users.\n- **User Management**\n    - Admins can manage user accounts, including adding, updating, or removing users.\n- **Admin Dashboard**\n    - A centralized panel for managing all application features and settings.\n\nHere are some important details:\n\n#### Viewing Issue\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123100319.png> \"a\")\n\nMetadata are displayed nicely with Jinja template, while handling document display required additional effort. These document(pdf) files are stored in a private Google Cloud Storage bucket. When a file is requested, a signed url expiring in `FILE_LINK_EXPIRE_TIME_SEC` seconds will be generated to ensure security.\n\n> I spent nights and days wrestling with Google PDF proxy issue. I even got a little depressed after figuring out the PDF viewer's strict url format. Fortunately, the idea of utilizing Cloudflare proxy as microservice saved my day.\n\nHowever, since the Google PDF viewer does not support file url with `GET` parameters, I deployed a microservice for specifically handling file proxy. When a document is requested, the signed URL is sent to the proxy, which converts it into a parameter-free URL, which is then embedded into the template. When the document page is rendered by the user, the proxy forwards the request to the original signed URL. This approach effectively secures the URLs while ensuring smooth functionality.\n\n#### Searching with fields\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123100629.png> \"a\")\n\nThis is achieved through SQL ORM technology, similar to [core code of Webird](https://blog.gu33gu.asia/2024/07/29/How-I-built-Webird/#Main-Functions). Being different from the core code of webird, the fields are obtained through `GET params`. Since several pages have the same searching form, a standalone template for searching field is reused.\n\n#### Auth and Access Control\n\nConsidering some students deliver some sensitive ideas on the newspaper, we may control the access to the whole database.\n\nLibrary `flask_login` is applied to manage user. I customized the original user model, where I added a column `view_power`. The `view_power` determines the power of the user to access to articles. Each document has its own view power. Only if the user has equal or greater `view_power`, he is able to access to it.\n\nA customizable stopword list is applied to filter searching keywords. This can be modified easily by admin.\n\n#### Admin Panel\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123101857.png> \"a\")\n\nThe panel can only be accessed by admin users, and its portal is only visible to admin in the menu. In this panel, I enable admin user to operate with the database in a friendly manner. It enables the admin to manage any data, including the categories, document itself, stopwords, and about (markdown). It even allows admin to add, delete, and manage the users, including their username, password, view power.\n\nThis section will introduce several notable details of some functions.\n\n##### Upload\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123105737.png> \"a\")\n\nAdmin can simply fill in the form to complete an upload.\n\nThe uploaded pdf's text is extracted directly (not OCR) to ensure simplicity, using `pdfplumber`. Data type `Long text` is applied to store the text in the db. The file is uploaded to the Google storage.\n\n##### Manage User\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123110145.png> \"a\")\n\nUsers can be managed on the page.\n\nThe backend makesure the admin cannot change its own name or password to improve maintainbility.\n\n### Cache Optimization\n\nEverything requiring db quests are cached to enhance performance and reduce cost. `flask_caching` is applied.\n\nEvery operation of questing db is written as standalone function with cache decorators. Example:\n\n```Python\n@cache.cached(key_prefix=\"get_archive\", timeout=86400)\ndef get_archive() -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves a list of newspaper issues that the current user has permission to view,\n    ordered by issued time in descending order.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of `NewspaperIssue` objects that the current user can view.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Query for issues the current user can view\n    issues = NewspaperIssue.query.filter(\n        NewspaperIssue.view_power <= current_user.view_power\n    ).order_by(NewspaperIssue.issued_time.desc()).all()\n    \n    return issues\n```\n\nEverytime admin modifies document data through admin panel, cache are deleted by calling:\n\n```python\ndef update_cache(modified_issue: NewspaperIssue) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Updates the application cache to ensure consistency after a newspaper issue is modified.\n\n    This function invalidates cache entries that might be affected by changes to the \n    given issue, ensuring stale data is removed. Specifically, it clears cached results for:\n    - Issue retrieval by ID, date ranges, and specific time intervals (year, month, day).\n    - Functions retrieving the archive or related metadata like issue date intervals.\n    - Category-related functions to reflect potential changes in categorization.\n\n    Args:\n        modified_issue (NewspaperIssue): The newspaper issue object that was modified.\n\n    Cache Entries Invalidated:\n        - `get_issue_date_interval`: Clears the date range cache.\n        - `get_archive`: Clears the entire archive cache.\n        - `get_issue`: Clears the cache for the specific issue by ID.\n        - `get_year_month_issues`: Clears cached issues for the issue's year and month.\n        - `get_day_issues`: Clears cached issues for the issue's specific day.\n        - `get_all_category`: Clears category-related caches in case of category updates.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    cache.delete('get_issue_date_interval')\n    cache.delete('get_archive')\n    cache.delete_memoized(get_issue, modified_issue.id)\n    cache.delete_memoized(\n        get_year_month_issues,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.year,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.month\n    )\n    cache.delete_memoized(\n        get_day_issues,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.year,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.month,\n        modified_issue.issued_time.day\n    )\n    cache.delete('get_all_category')\n```\n\nThe only problem here is the `timeout` param in the decorator. You get error when using `current_app.config` to obtain expiring time. \n\nsee more information about cache in official document:  [Flask-Caching — Flask-Caching 1.0.0 documentation](https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\n### Database Initialization\n\nRemember to set `auto_increment=True` for `id` column in your models.\n\nBecause of the usage of searching in `LongText` in MySQL, we need to `add fulltext index`. The app factory is written like below:\n\n```python\n    # Initializes the database, creates tables, and ensures default records exist.\n    from .models import Config as db_Config, Category  # Import your Config model\n    from .utils import ini_users  # Assuming ini_users is in utils.py\n    # print(\"ini0!!!\")\n    with app.app_context():\n        db.create_all()  # Create all tables if they don't already exist\n        \n        # Ensure there is at least one Config record\n        if not db_Config.query.first():\n            default_config = db_Config(stopwords='')\n            db.session.add(default_config)\n            db.session.commit()\n        Category.get_or_create_default()\n        # Initialize default users or other essential data\n        ini_users()\n        try:\n            sql = text('ALTER TABLE newspaper_issue ADD FULLTEXT INDEX idx_fulltext_content (content);')\n            result = db.session.execute(sql)\n        except:\n            pass\n\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Web Service\n\nOn google cloud run. Docker build. Nice and simple.\n\nThe domain does not work at first, if you integrate it directly with the cloud run service. A Cloudflare worker is applied to proxy the default url.\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n    // The target Cloud Run URL\n    const targetUrl = 'https://cloud_run.url';\n    \n    // Construct the new URL by appending the requested path and query\n    const url = new URL(request.url);\n    const target = new URL(targetUrl);\n    target.pathname = url.pathname;\n    target.search = url.search;\n\n    // Create a request object with the original headers, pointing to the new target URL\n    const proxyRequest = new Request(target.toString(), request);\n    \n    // Fetch the response from the Cloud Run service\n    const response = await fetch(proxyRequest);\n\n    // Return the response, passing through the headers and status from Cloud Run\n    return new Response(response.body, response);\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\n### Database\n\nGoogle SQL database. Most of the fee comes from here. \n\nSince this project will not serve great traffic, a shared CPU is selected to reduce fee.\n\nThe access should remain private, with specific ip address. Do NOT use `0.0.0.0` to expose it to public. The database is accessed through a socket URI like this in production: \n```Python\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = \"mysql+pymysql://username:password@/database_name?unix_socket=/cloudsql/project-id:region:instance-name\"\n```\n\n### File Proxy Service\n\nCloudflare worker + KV database. Completely free.\n\n1. **Create a Cloudflare Worker**:\n    \n    - Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and create a worker.\n2. **Setup KV Namespace**:\n    \n    - Under \"Workers,\" go to \"KV\" → \"Create Namespace\" → Name it (e.g., `TEMP_LINKS`).\n3. **Connect KV in worker configuration**:\n    \n\t- Under \"Settings\" -> \"Domains & Routes\" -> \"Bindings\":\n\t- ![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted image 20250123114652.png> \"a\")\n    \n4. **Write the Worker Code**: plug in the proxy code: [link to Gist](https://gist.github.com/gugu-py/bc2054831abaf9e57f47d71cb4c44e3f)\n    \n5. **Deploy**\n\n## Collaboration and Lessons Learned\n\n![](<https:/blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/b3e1ac0a958b09e402f1f01c92e66670 1.jpg> \"a\")\n\n> \"Just test this one more feature, please!\" Their enthusiasm kept me motivated.\n\nI would like to appreciate the effort of members (Giulio and Joseph, on two sides of the image) from the Challenger. Although being busy, they are still willing to spend time on pushing the project forward. These were what we did to make this project progress smooth and productive.\n\n**Small team.** Smaller team is best for communication. There is only one developer for the project, so the code style is consistent.\n\n**Spark passion.** Through multiple face-to-face meetings and random talks, the team resulted in a proactive atmosphere. We were able to develop the blueprint and feature list of the application in a few days.\n\n**Regular Report.** The regular report of development progress not only contributes to the proactive and productive atmosphere, but also enabled new features to be tested in no time by non-tech members.\n\nHowever, despite being productive and efficient most of the time, there were some incidents that greatly degraded the progress of project. Here is one lesson learnt.\n\n**Instruct with greater care.** When one (especially non-tech) is prompted to do something unfamiliar, their proactivity will be severely impacted, and thus cause considerable delay in work. This happens when I let the Challenger coreteam member to tryout the upload panel, he misunderstood the task and thought it would involve coding. This caused the task be delayed for at least 2 weeks. After a face to face demonstration of the user-friendly admin panel, the testing is finished in no time.\n\n## Future\n\nThere will be more customization features, such as:\n- color pallete\n- background image\n\nAlso, there should be mechanism to allow reset admin's password. I would like to migrate MySQL to MongoDB to reduce cost.\n\nIf having some time, I want to reconstruct the whole project, using FastAPI + Vue.js to make it more modern.\n\nThere are a lot to do to enhance its tech stack, but the most critical and most difficult thing is future maintainance. I want this archive to outlast my time at school, becoming a legacy for future generations of _The Challenger_. That's why finding someone passionate enough to maintain it after I graduate feels so crucial.\n\n> Creating _archive.cs-csc.online_ taught me not only about web development, but also about conversations and perseverance. It reminded me why I love coding—turning small conversations into tangible, meaningful tools for our community.\n\n","slug":"CSC-Archive-Re","published":1,"updated":"2025-03-22T02:52:36.755Z","_id":"cm8jm164200006sijaznr8twf","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"content":"<h1 id=\"How-I-built-archive-cs-csc-online\"><a href=\"#How-I-built-archive-cs-csc-online\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How I built archive.cs-csc.online\"></a>How I built archive.cs-csc.online</h1><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250322104422.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"It-all-began-with-a-random-talk…\"><a href=\"#It-all-began-with-a-random-talk…\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"It all began with a random talk…\"></a>It all began with a random talk…</h2><p>It was a routine supper, but I happened to sit with Joseph, Giulio, and Richard Yiu. During our random conversation, as we were talking about Joseph’s role at the <em>Challenger</em>, our school newspaper, he told us they were seeking to make a website to display them. I agreed to help him, and a proposal was developed soon.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250322102929.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Right after the dinner, I began to work on this project. My knowledge on Flask and MySQL paid off, enabling me to finish the prototype less than 24 hours. I made a brief demonstration to the coreteam. Everyone was astonished by my productivity. Soon a further plan was made, with a friendly and proactive atmosphere set.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/d466f2f80a40bed8901d2190027c806.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>We even met with the principal and the market department of the school to further propagate this project.</p>\n<p>This project is the first most production-ready application I have ever made. Different from previous projects, I spent most of the time on improving the stability and performance instead of developing all different functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Features-and-Cores\"><a href=\"#Features-and-Cores\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Features and Cores\"></a>Features and Cores</h2><h3 id=\"Overall-Design\"><a href=\"#Overall-Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overall Design\"></a>Overall Design</h3><p>The project ends up with 3 parts: Flask as the core unit, MySQL for database, and a seperate service for file proxy.</p>\n<p>Given the moderate expected traffic, I chose Flask for its simplicity, ease of deployment, and proven stability. Although frameworks like FastAPI offer better performance, Flask provided the ideal balance of speed and maintainability for our use case.</p>\n<p>For MySQL, I used it because it was the only database I was good at. MySQL is famous for its enterprise-level stability and simplicity to act with Flask, but it is also infamous for its cost. If given enough time on this project in the future, I will consider to use MongoDB as a better alternative for its flexibility and cost efficiency. (I learnt this database in a new project ClioCard.)</p>\n<p>The reason why I decided to use a seperate file proxy, is to hide the real file blob of the pdf files. The proxy links should expire after a certain amount of time. This would protect the pdf files from unauthorized sharing. Taking account of Flask’s synchronous nature, proxying one file will use a whole thread of the web server. This will severely degrade the performance when multiple users are requesting files simultaneously. Therefore, the best approach is to apply a seperate microservice. Because of the proxy unit’s simplicity, I used a Cloudflare worker to do the job.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Database-Overview\"><a href=\"#Database-Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Database Overview\"></a>Database Overview</h3><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250115133012.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I keep the database setup simple. </p>\n<p>The database consists of four main tables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Category</strong>: Organizes newspaper issues into categories (<code>1-to-many</code> relationship with <code>newspaper_issue</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Newspaper Issue</strong>: Stores issue metadata (e.g., <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>issued_time</code>), PDF paths, and <code>view_power</code> for access control.</li>\n<li><strong>User</strong>: Manages login credentials, roles, and <code>view_power</code> to enforce access restrictions.</li>\n<li><strong>Config</strong>: Holds global settings like stopwords for search and “About” page content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Key Notes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Categories link to issues; access control uses <code>view_power</code> matching between users and issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Simplicity for scalability, with clear access control and category-based organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Features-and-notable-details\"><a href=\"#Features-and-notable-details\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Features and notable details\"></a>Features and notable details</h3><ol>\n<li>User Experience &amp; Navigation</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homepage</strong><ul>\n<li>Provides a general overview of the application and its purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Archive Viewing</strong><ul>\n<li>Seamlessly access and browse archived issues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Date-based Navigation</strong><ul>\n<li>Quickly find issues by specific months or days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Search Functionality</strong><ul>\n<li>Perform efficient keyword-based searches.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Document Viewing</strong><ul>\n<li>Easily access full documents or their text content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Content Management</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>About Page Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Edit and update the “About” section directly from the admin panel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Category Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Add, edit, or remove categories to organize content effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>File Uploading</strong><ul>\n<li>Upload and manage files or documents with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Issue Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Edit or delete specific newspaper issues in the archive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Stopword Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Customize and edit stopwords to improve search results.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>User Administration &amp; Security</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Authentication</strong><ul>\n<li>Enable secure login for existing users and registration for new users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>User Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Admins can manage user accounts, including adding, updating, or removing users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Admin Dashboard</strong><ul>\n<li>A centralized panel for managing all application features and settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some important details:</p>\n<h4 id=\"Viewing-Issue\"><a href=\"#Viewing-Issue\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Viewing Issue\"></a>Viewing Issue</h4><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250123100319.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Metadata are displayed nicely with Jinja template, while handling document display required additional effort.

Although being busy, they are still willing to spend time on pushing the project forward. These were what we did to make this project progress smooth and productive.</p>\n<p><strong>Small team.</strong> Smaller team is best for communication. There is only one developer for the project, so the code style is consistent.</p>\n<p><strong>Spark passion.</strong> Through multiple face-to-face meetings and random talks, the team resulted in a proactive atmosphere. We were able to develop the blueprint and feature list of the application in a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Report.</strong> The regular report of development progress not only contributes to the proactive and productive atmosphere, but also enabled new features to be tested in no time by non-tech members.</p>\n<p>However, despite being productive and efficient most of the time, there were some incidents that greatly degraded the progress of project. Here is one lesson learnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Instruct with greater care.</strong> When one (especially non-tech) is prompted to do something unfamiliar, their proactivity will be severely impacted, and thus cause considerable delay in work. This happens when I let the Challenger coreteam member to tryout the upload panel, he misunderstood the task and thought it would involve coding. This caused the task be delayed for at least 2 weeks. After a face to face demonstration of the user-friendly admin panel, the testing is finished in no time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Future\"><a href=\"#Future\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Future\"></a>Future</h2><p>There will be more customization features, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>color pallete</li>\n<li>background image</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, there should be mechanism to allow reset admin’s password.

That’s why finding someone passionate enough to maintain it after I graduate feels so crucial.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Creating <em>archive.cs-csc.online</em> taught me not only about web development, but also about conversations and perseverance.

During our random conversation, as we were talking about Joseph’s role at the <em>Challenger</em>, our school newspaper, he told us they were seeking to make a website to display them. I agreed to help him, and a proposal was developed soon.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250322102929.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Right after the dinner, I began to work on this project. My knowledge on Flask and MySQL paid off, enabling me to finish the prototype less than 24 hours. I made a brief demonstration to the coreteam. Everyone was astonished by my productivity. Soon a further plan was made, with a friendly and proactive atmosphere set.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/d466f2f80a40bed8901d2190027c806.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>We even met with the principal and the market department of the school to further propagate this project.</p>\n<p>This project is the first most production-ready application I have ever made. Different from previous projects, I spent most of the time on improving the stability and performance instead of developing all different functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Features-and-Cores\"><a href=\"#Features-and-Cores\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Features and Cores\"></a>Features and Cores</h2><h3 id=\"Overall-Design\"><a href=\"#Overall-Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overall Design\"></a>Overall Design</h3><p>The project ends up with 3 parts: Flask as the core unit, MySQL for database, and a seperate service for file proxy.</p>\n<p>Given the moderate expected traffic, I chose Flask for its simplicity, ease of deployment, and proven stability. Although frameworks like FastAPI offer better performance, Flask provided the ideal balance of speed and maintainability for our use case.</p>\n<p>For MySQL, I used it because it was the only database I was good at. MySQL is famous for its enterprise-level stability and simplicity to act with Flask, but it is also infamous for its cost. If given enough time on this project in the future, I will consider to use MongoDB as a better alternative for its flexibility and cost efficiency. (I learnt this database in a new project ClioCard.)</p>\n<p>The reason why I decided to use a seperate file proxy, is to hide the real file blob of the pdf files. The proxy links should expire after a certain amount of time. This would protect the pdf files from unauthorized sharing. Taking account of Flask’s synchronous nature, proxying one file will use a whole thread of the web server. This will severely degrade the performance when multiple users are requesting files simultaneously. Therefore, the best approach is to apply a seperate microservice. Because of the proxy unit’s simplicity, I used a Cloudflare worker to do the job.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Database-Overview\"><a href=\"#Database-Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Database Overview\"></a>Database Overview</h3><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250115133012.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>I keep the database setup simple. </p>\n<p>The database consists of four main tables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Category</strong>: Organizes newspaper issues into categories (<code>1-to-many</code> relationship with <code>newspaper_issue</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Newspaper Issue</strong>: Stores issue metadata (e.g., <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>issued_time</code>), PDF paths, and <code>view_power</code> for access control.</li>\n<li><strong>User</strong>: Manages login credentials, roles, and <code>view_power</code> to enforce access restrictions.</li>\n<li><strong>Config</strong>: Holds global settings like stopwords for search and “About” page content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Key Notes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Categories link to issues; access control uses <code>view_power</code> matching between users and issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Simplicity for scalability, with clear access control and category-based organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Features-and-notable-details\"><a href=\"#Features-and-notable-details\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Features and notable details\"></a>Features and notable details</h3><ol>\n<li>User Experience &amp; Navigation</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homepage</strong><ul>\n<li>Provides a general overview of the application and its purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Archive Viewing</strong><ul>\n<li>Seamlessly access and browse archived issues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Date-based Navigation</strong><ul>\n<li>Quickly find issues by specific months or days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Search Functionality</strong><ul>\n<li>Perform efficient keyword-based searches.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Document Viewing</strong><ul>\n<li>Easily access full documents or their text content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Content Management</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>About Page Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Edit and update the “About” section directly from the admin panel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Category Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Add, edit, or remove categories to organize content effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>File Uploading</strong><ul>\n<li>Upload and manage files or documents with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Issue Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Edit or delete specific newspaper issues in the archive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Stopword Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Customize and edit stopwords to improve search results.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>User Administration &amp; Security</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Authentication</strong><ul>\n<li>Enable secure login for existing users and registration for new users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>User Management</strong><ul>\n<li>Admins can manage user accounts, including adding, updating, or removing users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Admin Dashboard</strong><ul>\n<li>A centralized panel for managing all application features and settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some important details:</p>\n<h4 id=\"Viewing-Issue\"><a href=\"#Viewing-Issue\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Viewing Issue\"></a>Viewing Issue</h4><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250123100319.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Metadata are displayed nicely with Jinja template, while handling document display required additional effort. These document(pdf) files are stored in a private Google Cloud Storage bucket. When a file is requested, a signed url expiring in <code>FILE_LINK_EXPIRE_TIME_SEC</code> seconds will be generated to ensure security.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I spent nights and days wrestling with Google PDF proxy issue. I even got a little depressed after figuring out the PDF viewer’s strict url format. Fortunately, the idea of utilizing Cloudflare proxy as microservice saved my day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, since the Google PDF viewer does not support file url with <code>GET</code> parameters, I deployed a microservice for specifically handling file proxy. When a document is requested, the signed URL is sent to the proxy, which converts it into a parameter-free URL, which is then embedded into the template. When the document page is rendered by the user, the proxy forwards the request to the original signed URL. This approach effectively secures the URLs while ensuring smooth functionality.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Searching-with-fields\"><a href=\"#Searching-with-fields\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Searching with fields\"></a>Searching with fields</h4><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250123100629.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>This is achieved through SQL ORM technology, similar to <a href=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/2024/07/29/How-I-built-Webird/#Main-Functions\">core code of Webird</a>.

Each document has its own view power. Only if the user has equal or greater <code>view_power</code>, he is able to access to it.</p>\n<p>A customizable stopword list is applied to filter searching keywords.

In this panel, I enable admin user to operate with the database in a friendly manner.

It even allows admin to add, delete, and manage the users, including their username, password, view power.</p>\n<p>This section will introduce several notable details of some functions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Upload\"><a href=\"#Upload\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Upload\"></a>Upload</h5><p><img data-src=\"https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020250123105737.png\" title=\"a\"></p>\n<p>Admin can simply fill in the form to complete an upload.</p>\n<p>The uploaded pdf’s text is extracted directly (not OCR) to ensure simplicity, using <code>pdfplumber</code>.

After a face to face demonstration of the user-friendly admin panel, the testing is finished in no time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Future\"><a href=\"#Future\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Future\"></a>Future</h2><p>There will be more customization features, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>color pallete</li>\n<li>background image</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, there should be mechanism to allow reset admin’s password. I would like to migrate MySQL to MongoDB to reduce cost.</p>\n<p>If having some time, I want to reconstruct the whole project, using FastAPI + Vue.js to make it more modern.</p>\n<p>There are a lot to do to enhance its tech stack, but the most critical and most difficult thing is future maintainance. I want this archive to outlast my time at school, becoming a legacy for future generations of <em>The Challenger</em>. That’s why finding someone passionate enough to maintain it after I graduate feels so crucial.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Creating <em>archive.cs-csc.online</em> taught me not only about web development, but also about conversations and perseverance. It reminded me why I love coding—turning small conversations into tangible, meaningful tools for our community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"title":"Rust is Poem, Code like a Poet","date":"2025-04-12T03:15:41.000Z","_content":"\n# Rust is Poem, Code like a Poet\n\nWhen I first met Rust, it felt strangely familiar—C++'s control and Python's expressiveness.
