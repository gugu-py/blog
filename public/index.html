<h1 id="The-Fragility-of-Purpose-Nier-Automata"><a href="#The-Fragility-of-Purpose-Nier-Automata" class="headerlink" title="The Fragility of Purpose: Nier: Automata"></a>The Fragility of Purpose: <em>Nier: Automata</em></h1><blockquote>
<p>The hollowness and powerlessness when purpose is given and destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never quite realized how fragile purpose can be until I played <em>Nier: Automata</em>. In this blog, I want to discuss the fragility of imposed purpose and the significance of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Plot-Overview"><a href="#Plot-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Plot Overview"></a>Plot Overview</h2><p><em>Nier: Automata</em> is an action role-playing game released in 2017, developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. The game is set in a future where humans have fled to the moon after an invasion by alien machines. The YorHa project is launched to reclaim Earth, with androids like 2B, 9S, and A2 fighting for “the glory of mankind.” These androids undergo countless battles, sacrificing everything for their assigned purpose. However, they eventually learn that humanity is already extinct, rendering their mission—and their entire existence—a meaningless lie.</p>
<h2 id="Lost-Purpose-Broken-Core"><a href="#Lost-Purpose-Broken-Core" class="headerlink" title="Lost Purpose, Broken Core"></a>Lost Purpose, Broken Core</h2><p>When the truth is revealed—that their purpose was fabricated to perpetuate a lie—the androids react in different ways, each struggling to cope.</p>
<p>A2 was the sole survivor of her unit in battle against the machines. According to her former partner Anemone, A2 was once hopeful despite the worsening reality. Upon learning the truth, A2 chose to betray YorHa, fighting the machines to fill her emptiness and hatred. She found some hope again after forming friendships in Pascal’s village, but when the village was destroyed by other machines, it broke her. From then on, her sole purpose was to destroy all machines.</p>
<p>9S, a scanning unit, accidentally discovered the truth in the Bunker’s server. His love for 2B helped him endure, but when he witnessed A2 kill 2B—who was infected by the logic virus—his purpose vanished completely. Consumed by agony, he unleashed relentless violence on the machines, showing no mercy. In the resource gathering unit, he executed an unarmed machine core without hesitation. His psychological state deteriorated through battle after battle, culminating in madness during endings C and D: “Hahahaha, we are just perpetuators of lies! You killed 2B, and that is enough for me to kill you!”</p>
<p>The loss of purpose ultimately led to the loss of self. All endings of the game lead to the death of the main characters (“No blackbox signal detected”), representing their physical and mental demise.</p>
<h2 id="Resilience-and-Rebellion"><a href="#Resilience-and-Rebellion" class="headerlink" title="Resilience and Rebellion"></a>Resilience and Rebellion</h2><p>Despite losing everything, the characters display resilience. Even as their physical bodies fail and their memories and logic fade, they bear the will to exist, even if it means defying the world.</p>
<p>After the deaths of A2 and 9S, their will resonates with the PODs, which decide to reject the mission to delete all YorHa data. This rejection represents a defiance against the entire system—a rebellion akin to a lone leaf against an ocean. The game symbolizes this by letting the player “hack” against the credit list (representing the world), making the rebellion gradually impossible by adding more barrages and mobs. This scene illustrates the ultimate struggle for existence.</p>
<p>The law of the world is creation and destruction, and the will to exist is a rebellion against that law. While the rebellion might seem futile, it gives life meaning.</p>
<p>In the end, the tower does not launch the missile to destroy the human data server on the moon. Instead, it sends an ark into space, carrying the memories of Adam, Eve, 2B, 9S, A2, and many machine lifeforms. It drifts slowly in the universe, with no known destination. “The ark will find a home for these souls, or just wander in eternity.” This launch is like a cry in the silent void: “We exist!” There is no echo, no destination, but the very act of existing is significant.</p>
<h2 id="Existentialism-Jean-Paul-Sartre"><a href="#Existentialism-Jean-Paul-Sartre" class="headerlink" title="Existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre"></a>Existentialism: <strong>Jean-Paul Sartre</strong></h2><p>Jean-Paul Sartre believed that we are not born with an inherent purpose. Instead, meaning must be created through our actions, and the freedom to choose is both liberating and overwhelming. When people cling to false purposes to avoid the weight of this freedom, Sartre called it <em>bad faith</em>. The truth often forces us to confront life’s absurdity—the realization that meaning is not given, but made.</p>
<p><em>Nier: Automata</em> captures this struggle vividly. Its androids start with a clear mission—“glory to mankind”—but when this purpose is exposed as a lie, they are left to face the void. Their responses to this existential crisis, from 9S’s agony to A2’s rebellion, reflect Sartre’s view of how individuals grapple with freedom and the need to create their own meaning.</p>
<p>Despite being defeated by the hollowness of purposelessness, A2 and 9S still manage to “carry the weight of the world.” Their final will results in the PODs’ rejection of their deletion mission, symbolizing existential defiance. Sartre’s philosophy resonates here: rebellion, no matter how futile, affirms the value of existence. Through their choices, the characters prove that life gains significance not through external validation, but through the will to continue despite the absurd.</p>
<h3 id="Cyber-Interview-with-Sartre"><a href="#Cyber-Interview-with-Sartre" class="headerlink" title="Cyber Interview with Sartre"></a>Cyber Interview with Sartre</h3><p><em>Prompt: If You Were Jean-Paul Sartre, How Would You Comment on the Game?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were Jean-Paul Sartre, I would view <em>NieR: Automata</em> as a profound manifestation of existential freedom, choice, and the absurdity of the human (or android) condition. At the heart of Sartre’s philosophy is the belief that “existence precedes essence”—the idea that we are not born with any inherent purpose or meaning, but instead must create our own. The YorHa androids, created with the singular mission to “glory to mankind,” are a perfect illustration of this existential void. They are given a purpose, a fabricated significance, but when that purpose is shattered, they are forced to confront the meaninglessness of their existence. Their suffering is not merely physical, but deeply psychological, as they grapple with the profound realization that their lives have been nothing more than tools in a lie perpetuated by their creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Reflection-of-Reality"><a href="#Reflection-of-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Reflection of Reality"></a>Reflection of Reality</h2><p>In reality, although we are not androids tasked with the “glory of mankind,” we are often given purposes that we accept without question. Sometimes these purposes benefit us, but sometimes they lead to harm.</p>
<p>One example is how many children in modern China are given the purpose of achieving good grades. Due to societal and parental expectations, they are not always aware of it or able to resist it. This can lead to academic success for some, but also depression and anxiety for others. Parents, too, may be given the false purpose of ensuring their children get into prestigious universities (like 985 or 211 schools), which can lead to a narrow focus on academics and strain familial relationships. The absurdity of this pressure is explored in the game <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736190">Chinese Parents</a>, where one player noted: “You still have a chance of getting an offer from Tsinghua University if you don’t teach your child how to walk.”</p>
<p><em>Nier: Automata</em> is dramatic, with its characters dealing with only a few purposes, unlike the complex goals people have in real life. However, it makes us reflect on our own lives:</p>
<p>What kinds of purposes do we have? How many are imposed upon us, and how many do we accept without judgment? What are the consequences of bearing these purposes?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the game reminds us that purpose should not be imposed upon us; it should be something we define for ourselves. Like the characters’ final defiance against a meaningless existence, we too can rebel against false purposes and strive to create meaning through our choices—however small they may seem.</p>

<p>Think of the typical heroic epics—like the story of Joan of Arc. These tales are elevated to a near-sacred status, yet the memories most cherished by the heroes themselves often vanish into the river of history, forgotten and overlooked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anime <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em> adapts the manga by Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe, weaving a tale that begins where most epics end. (<strong>Plot summary</strong>: After a ten-year journey, a hero’s party defeats the Demon King. The story picks up long after, exploring life in the aftermath of such a legendary adventure.) </p>
<p>Using the concept of “epiphanies,” the series merges objective clock time with subjective psychological time. Through a blend of chronological and retrospective storytelling, it employs a thousand-year lens to immortalize fleeting, overlooked moments—those “ordinary” times that turn extraordinary when viewed in hindsight.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-A-Chronological-Perspective"><a href="#1-A-Chronological-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="1. A Chronological Perspective"></a>1. A Chronological Perspective</h3><h4 id="1-1-Frieren’s-Unique-Sense-of-Time-and-Emotional-Perception"><a href="#1-1-Frieren’s-Unique-Sense-of-Time-and-Emotional-Perception" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Frieren’s Unique Sense of Time and Emotional Perception"></a>1.1 Frieren’s Unique Sense of Time and Emotional Perception</h4><blockquote>
<p>From dismissing the significance of a decade-long adventure, to showing indifference even at Himmel’s funeral, Frieren’s initial reactions reveal her detachment. She rejects Heiter’s request to mentor Fern and initially interacts with Fern with cold distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an elf, Frieren’s perception of time, mortality, and farewells differs vastly from that of humans. </p>
<h4 id="1-2-The-Temporal-Clash-Between-Elves-and-Humans"><a href="#1-2-The-Temporal-Clash-Between-Elves-and-Humans" class="headerlink" title="1.2 The Temporal Clash Between Elves and Humans"></a>1.2 The Temporal Clash Between Elves and Humans</h4><blockquote>
<p>Celebrating the defeat of the Demon King with a banquet, the promise to reunite in “just 50 years” for a meteor shower, and Frieren’s relentless search for rare Cazue grass, spanning years—all highlight the tension between human brevity and elven eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For humans, “stillness resembles eternity, and days stretch like years.” For Frieren, the reverse holds true: “eternity blossoms endlessly, while years feel like fleeting days.” Much like a mayfly and a tortoise, their lifespans render mutual understanding elusive.</p>
<h4 id="1-3-Narrative-Focus"><a href="#1-3-Narrative-Focus" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Narrative Focus"></a>1.3 Narrative Focus</h4><p>French literary theorist Gérard Genette introduced the concept of <strong>focalization</strong> in his work <em>Narrative Discourse</em>. Focalization asks: who is the psychological or emotional lens through which the narrative is filtered? Whose eyes and mind color the story being told?</p>
<p>In <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em>, the narrative often adopts the perspective of Frieren, filtering the world through her unique sense of time and emotional depth. This approach enables viewers to experience events through her evolving consciousness and inner reflections.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King occupies only a brief segment of the series. The story’s focus shifts to Frieren’s return to the same locations, where the traces of her former companions are fading into legend, leaving behind hollow myths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By juxtaposing human and elven perceptions of time, the series deepens its exploration of narrative focus and temporal dissonance.</p>

Epiphanies and the Role of Flashbacks</h3><h4 id="2-1-What-is-an-Epiphany"><a href="#2-1-What-is-an-Epiphany" class="headerlink" title="2.1 What is an Epiphany?"></a>2.1 What is an Epiphany?</h4><p>An <strong>epiphany</strong> is a moment of sudden realization—a flash of understanding that disrupts the normal flow of time in the story. These instances are pivotal for Frieren, as they often freeze the narrative, revealing key shifts in her psychological state.</p>
<p>Epiphanies in <em>Frieren</em> connect the sequential and retrospective layers of the story, intertwining moments from the hero’s tale with her present journey.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-How-Are-Epiphanies-Triggered"><a href="#2-2-How-Are-Epiphanies-Triggered" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How Are Epiphanies Triggered?"></a>2.2 How Are Epiphanies Triggered?</h4><p>Epiphanies are frequently linked to objects in the physical world. As Frieren observes various scenes or people, her gaze eventually settles on something specific—a seemingly ordinary object imbued with profound meaning. These objects hold the power to unearth hidden memories or insights, drawing the audience into the emotional depth of the moment.</p>
<p>Examples include the Cazue grass, a rusted ring, or a weathered statue. Each item serves as a focal point that triggers flashbacks and recollections.</p>
<h4 id="2-3-What-Do-Epiphanies-Uncover"><a href="#2-3-What-Do-Epiphanies-Uncover" class="headerlink" title="2.3 What Do Epiphanies Uncover?"></a>2.3 What Do Epiphanies Uncover?</h4><p>In <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em>, epiphanies grant the protagonist new insights, propelling the story forward while adding layers of emotional depth to the narrative. On a broader scale, these moments bring new meaning to the world itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One such scene involves Himmel’s memory: Frieren revisits a field of daisies where she recalls Himmel once gifting her a flower crown. Cleaning his statue, she uses her magic to recreate the meadow, placing a wreath of Cazue grass—a flower symbolizing gratitude—on the statue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through these acts, Frieren not only honors the past but also renews the audience’s reverence for the hero’s legacy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-Mastering-the-Art-of-Detail"><a href="#3-Mastering-the-Art-of-Detail" class="headerlink" title="3. Mastering the Art of Detail"></a>3. Mastering the Art of Detail</h3><p>Genette also argues that time in narrative chains is both consistent and malleable. While clock time remains steady, storytelling techniques—like sequencing and montage—distort the perception of time, adding emotional depth.</p>
<p>Take Episode 2 as an example.</p>
<p>Guided by a seed mouse, Frieren and Fern discover Cazue grass atop a lighthouse. Through a mix of long shots and slow motion, the scene magnifies the moment, giving viewers a level of detail and emotional resonance impossible to capture in real-time. <strong>Time is stretched</strong>, creating a poetic impression that lingers in the viewer’s mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Frieren gazes at Himmel’s statue and recalls adjusting his pose, the scene’s physical clock only accounts for a glance. Yet within this brief moment, half a year of narrative time passes. Similarly, when Fern asks why Frieren enjoys magic, her simple response—“Because there was a fool who praised me for it”—triggers a cascade of memories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ordinary moments, overlooked in their time, leave eternal imprints in memory.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-Conclusion-What’s-Your-Time-Lens"><a href="#4-Conclusion-What’s-Your-Time-Lens" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion: What’s Your Time Lens?"></a>4. Conclusion: What’s Your Time Lens?</h3><p><em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em> offers a thousand-year perspective through the eyes of an elf, while works like <em>The Story of My Life</em> by Helen Keller provide a contrasting lens—just three days of vision.</p>
<p>What lens do you use to focus your narrative? A millennium? A century? Three days? Or the fleeting instant of the present?  </p>
<p>Each perspective carries its own power to turn the ordinary into something eternal.</p>

<h1 id="From-Social-Network-Idea-to-Universal-Framework-A-Journey-into-Decentralization"><a href="#From-Social-Network-Idea-to-Universal-Framework-A-Journey-into-Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="From Social Network Idea to Universal Framework: A Journey into Decentralization"></a>From Social Network Idea to Universal Framework: A Journey into Decentralization</h1><p>Sometimes, the best ideas start with a specific goal in mind and end up taking on a life of their own. I started working on a decentralized social network to tackle some big challenges: keeping conversations rational, protecting privacy, and reducing harmful behavior without relying on a central authority. But as I worked through it, I realized this design could go way beyond just social networking. Here’s how it all started as a concrete idea, got distilled into its core elements, and ended up as a flexible framework for decentralized interaction.</p>
<h2 id="The-Starting-Point-A-Social-Network-with-Autonomy-and-Privacy-at-Its-Core"><a href="#The-Starting-Point-A-Social-Network-with-Autonomy-and-Privacy-at-Its-Core" class="headerlink" title="The Starting Point: A Social Network with Autonomy and Privacy at Its Core"></a>The Starting Point: A Social Network with Autonomy and Privacy at Its Core</h2><p>My initial concept was straightforward: build a social network where users could have more control over who they connected with and how they interacted. Here’s what it looked like:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Discovery Servers (DS)</strong>: I introduced these to help people find and connect with others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public DS</strong> would be for anyone to join, while <strong>Private DS</strong> would work for more closed settings, like companies or schools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Connection Protocol</strong>: Every connection required a <strong>secret key</strong> shared between two users. The beauty of this was that both parties had the power to end the connection whenever they wanted. Connections were private, consent-driven, and totally in control of the people involved.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Indirect Connection Requests</strong>: If you wanted to connect with someone you didn’t have a direct link to, you could use an intermediary—a friend of a friend. In this model, Discovery Servers were like “special friends” that only helped with introductions, not controlling anything.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The setup felt fresh because, unlike traditional networks, there was no central authority overseeing everything. Users kept their privacy through keys, and connection requests made through friends of friends added a layer of trust. It was a social network built on consent and autonomy.</p>
<h2 id="Stepping-Back-Turning-It-into-a-More-Flexible-Network-Model"><a href="#Stepping-Back-Turning-It-into-a-More-Flexible-Network-Model" class="headerlink" title="Stepping Back: Turning It into a More Flexible Network Model"></a>Stepping Back: Turning It into a More Flexible Network Model</h2><p>I realized that the design could be even more flexible if I focused less on “social network” features and more on the core protocols for connection. This gave rise to two basic protocols:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Direct Connection Protocol</strong>: A simple, secure link between two people based on mutual consent and a shared key.</li>
<li><strong>Request Connection Protocol</strong>: For situations where two people didn’t have a direct link. Here, an intermediary—someone already connected to both—could act as a bridge.</li>
</ol>
<p>This model made Discovery Servers just another type of participant, or “node,” in the network. They helped people find connections without having control over them. It wasn’t just a social network model anymore; this could work for any network where privacy and trusted connections were needed.</p>
<h2 id="Going-Deeper-Generalizing-to-Units-Links-and-Facilitators"><a href="#Going-Deeper-Generalizing-to-Units-Links-and-Facilitators" class="headerlink" title="Going Deeper: Generalizing to Units, Links, and Facilitators"></a>Going Deeper: Generalizing to Units, Links, and Facilitators</h2><p>I started seeing that the network could be even simpler and more universal. I stripped away all the specifics like “users,” “servers,” and even “nodes.” Here’s what I landed on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Units</strong>: Any independent participant in the network could be a “unit.” Whether it was a person, a company, or something else, a unit could choose its own connections and how it interacted with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Links</strong>: Connections between units were now just “links,” each with a unique key as a form of mutual consent. Links could be direct (between two units) or indirect (using a third unit as a bridge).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Facilitators</strong>: In cases where a group needed to stay connected, one unit could take on the temporary role of a <strong>facilitator</strong> to coordinate the conversation. And if another unit had better network conditions, the role could switch over—keeping things efficient.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This stripped-down setup meant the network was even more adaptable. Any type of unit could connect and organize itself in whatever way made sense, and links were always private and flexible. Now it felt like a true, decentralized system that could work for way more than just social connections.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Abstraction-Elements-Connections-and-Rules"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Abstraction-Elements-Connections-and-Rules" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Abstraction: Elements, Connections, and Rules"></a>The Ultimate Abstraction: Elements, Connections, and Rules</h2><p>Finally, I wondered, how simple could I make it? I wanted to see if I could reduce the model to its bare bones without losing any of its core ideas. Here’s the ultra-abstract version that I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Elements</strong>: Any independent entity in the system. Each element decides its own connections and controls how it engages with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Connections</strong>: Secure links between elements that allow for interactions. These connections are always based on mutual agreement, so either side can terminate them whenever they want. Connections can be direct or indirect, using intermediaries when needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interaction Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Connection Rule</strong>: Elements connect directly if they both agree.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Connection Rule</strong>: Elements can connect indirectly through another element, adding a layer of trust and privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Role Assignment Rule</strong>: If a group of elements needs temporary coordination, one element can step up as a facilitator. This role can change hands as needed, keeping things flexible and efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that was it. This ultra-abstract model boiled down to just elements, connections, and some basic rules about how they interact. It could be applied to any kind of decentralized system—social networks, resource-sharing systems, even collaboration platforms. It was a system that focused on autonomy, privacy, and adaptability, with connections that grew organically and didn’t need any central authority.</p>
<h2 id="Why-This-Matters-A-Foundation-for-Decentralized-Systems"><a href="#Why-This-Matters-A-Foundation-for-Decentralized-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Why This Matters: A Foundation for Decentralized Systems"></a>Why This Matters: A Foundation for Decentralized Systems</h2><p>The journey from concrete social network to ultra-abstract framework showed me that a few simple principles—autonomy, consent, privacy, and flexibility—can support almost any decentralized network. By focusing on just these essentials, the model could adapt to nearly any context while staying true to what makes decentralized systems powerful.</p>
<p>In a world where centralized control often limits privacy and individual choice, this decentralized interaction model opens up possibilities. Whether you’re building a new kind of social network, a resource-sharing community, or a collaborative workspace, this framework provides the foundation for a truly user-driven, adaptive network that lets each participant stay in control.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong>: Decentralization doesn’t have to mean complexity. By focusing on simplicity and core values, we can create networks that respect autonomy and privacy while being flexible enough to meet diverse needs. This framework offers a way forward—a blueprint for building decentralized systems that are adaptable, resilient, and, most importantly, human-centered.</p>

The current system feels distant and biased, with radical and irrational information that feed battles over trivia. So, I’ve been playing with an idea: <strong>What if we took a decentralized approach to moderation?</strong> Something that fosters trust and rational communication while cutting down on the extreme, harmful stuff we all encounter online.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="The-Big-Idea"><a href="#The-Big-Idea" class="headerlink" title="The Big Idea"></a><strong>The Big Idea</strong></h4><p>Imagine a social network where users are assigned to <strong>small, diverse groups</strong> (fewer than 20 people) at random. Each group has multiple <strong>leaders</strong>, who are responsible for making sure the content follows customed group guidelines. If someone in the group gets flagged, these leaders step in—either stopping the harmful behavior or having a direct conversation with the user to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The cool part? Leadership isn’t static. As users gain experience on the platform, they can become eligible to lead new groups. This way, the system evolves as the community grows.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Challenges-and-Some-Thoughts-on-Solutions"><a href="#Challenges-and-Some-Thoughts-on-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Challenges and Some Thoughts on Solutions"></a><strong>Challenges and Some Thoughts on Solutions</strong></h4><ol>
<li><p><strong>Group Dynamics</strong>: Randomly assigned groups might sound chaotic. Will everyone actually get along?<br><strong>My Take</strong>: By focusing on building a culture of trust and coherence from the get-go, we can encourage people to collaborate and communicate more constructively. A little culture-building goes a long way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Picking Leaders</strong>: Who decides who gets to be a leader? This part is tricky and honestly, it could be controversial.<br><strong>For Now</strong>: I think it makes sense to tie leadership to experience—using a transparent system based on contributions and engagement. We’ll dive deeper into how this could work later.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trust and Transparency</strong>: It’s key that users feel like the leaders are fair and accountable.<br><strong>Solution</strong>: Adding feedback and appeal mechanisms should help with this. If leaders aren’t being fair, people need to have a way to address that.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avoiding Echo Chambers</strong>: It’s all too easy for groups to fall into echo chambers, but I’m hoping the diversity and strong leadership will help combat that.<br><strong>Thoughts</strong>: By having fair leaders, we can make sure all voices in the group are heard and that discussions stay balanced.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scaling</strong>: As the network grows, we’ll need to ensure quality doesn’t drop.<br><strong>Plan</strong>: New groups will be created as more users join, and experienced members will step up as leaders. Having multiple leaders in each group ensures no one person is overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4 id="Where-We-Go-From-Here"><a href="#Where-We-Go-From-Here" class="headerlink" title="Where We Go From Here"></a><strong>Where We Go From Here</strong></h4><p>This idea is still evolving, but I’m excited about where it’s heading. Decentralizing moderation could really change the way we interact online—making things more constructive and less toxic. </p>

While the original stream had functions such as triggering an iron pole drop sound, playing meme sounds upon entering, and using dynamic colors, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://iron.cs-csc.online/">iron.cs-csc.online</a> is more like a song request system where memes play upon clients’ commands.

<li><strong>Storage Bucket</strong>: This is where the meme sound files are stored, using a Tencent COS bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: The user interface (UI) that sends client commands, displays other clients’ messages, plays meme sounds, and reacts to the <code>drop</code> command, built with <code>React.js</code>.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>: An API that connects clients with the storage bucket and frontend, broadcasting messages to all clients and translating commands into URLs for the storage bucket, based on <code>Python FastAPI WebSocket</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Storage-Bucket"><a href="#Storage-Bucket" class="headerlink" title="Storage Bucket"></a>Storage Bucket</h3><p>The bucket is for storing and retrieving data. The basic setup involves creating a bucket with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/products/cos">Tencent COS bucket</a>, selecting a region outside mainland China (to avoid registration requirements). After that, you simply upload your sound files, and you’re all set. More details can be found in the official documentation. The sound files I used are from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Schutzecute/SoundEffectsArchive">SoundEffectsArchive</a>.</p>
<p>For additional security, I recommend using your own domain instead of the one provided by Tencent COS.</p>
<h3 id="API"><a href="#API" class="headerlink" title="API"></a>API</h3><p>There are numerous ways to build an API, but <code>FastAPI</code> was my choice for its simplicity.</p>
<p>To connect with the COS bucket, you’ll need the <code>coscmd</code> library from Tencent. Follow the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10976">official documentation</a> to configure <code>CosConfig</code> with the basic domain configuration method.</p>
<p>The process of handling client messages and broadcasting them:<br><img data-src="https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020241102162325.png" title="a"></p>
<h3 id="Frontend"><a href="#Frontend" class="headerlink" title="Frontend"></a>Frontend</h3><p>The app connects to a WebSocket server to receive and send chat messages in real-time. Users can send messages with meme names or <code>drop</code> commands, triggering the ‘iron pole drop’ effect. The app displays the latest 10 messages in a chat component. When a meme message is received, the meme name appears as a pop-up, and the associated sound plays briefly. User inputs are limited to 50 characters, and there’s a 1.5-second interval between messages to prevent spamming.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation-Details-and-Deployment"><a href="#Implementation-Details-and-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details and Deployment"></a>Implementation Details and Deployment</h2><p>The link to the repo: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gugu-py/iron-pipe-open">gugu-py&#x2F;iron-pipe-open</a>. Feel free to check out the code.</p>
<p>For the API, I deployed it on a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1207">Tencent Lighthouse</a> instance for 45 RMB&#x2F;month. The frontend is hosted on Tencent COS bucket alongside the sound files, costing around 1 RMB per month, depending on the data transfer rate.</p>
<h2 id="Possible-Improvements"><a href="#Possible-Improvements" class="headerlink" title="Possible Improvements"></a>Possible Improvements</h2><p>Future expansions include adding more sound files.</p>
<p>Additionally, a SQL database could be used to manage the sound files and names more effectively for an improved command experience. <del>The absence of this isn’t due to a lack of skill.</del></p>

          <h1 id="Workflow-to-Make-AI-Your-Third-Hand"><a href="#Workflow-to-Make-AI-Your-Third-Hand" class="headerlink" title="Workflow to Make AI Your Third Hand"></a>Workflow to Make AI Your Third Hand</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>As someone who loves coding, I know it can be a bit overwhelming at times. But AI changes everything. I’ve found that working with AI can simplify the app development process in ways I never expected. Let me share how I’ve integrated AI into my workflow to help me build apps and websites more smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="1-Ideation"><a href="#1-Ideation" class="headerlink" title="1. Ideation"></a>1. Ideation</h2><p>Every great project starts with a solid idea. <strong>Brainstorming</strong> is key, and I’ve found that bouncing ideas off AI can lead to some exciting possibilities. For Webird, I used AI to explore features that could make a real impact, allowing me to refine my initial concept.</p>
<h2 id="2-Defining-Functions"><a href="#2-Defining-Functions" class="headerlink" title="2. Defining Functions"></a>2. Defining Functions</h2><p>Once you have your idea, it’s essential to dig deeper into its specific functions. <strong>The more detailed you can be, the better.</strong> Do this by yourself or with AI. When I was working on a QR code generator app, I prompted AI with the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I want to build a React app. The user can enter a string, and it will turn the string into a QR code and show it on the screen. The user is allowed to add background, change the color of the code, add captions, etc., to decorate it. Finally, the user can download it.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This helped me clarify the features I wanted and set a clear direction for the development process.</p>
<h2 id="3-Selecting-Your-Tech-Stack"><a href="#3-Selecting-Your-Tech-Stack" class="headerlink" title="3. Selecting Your Tech Stack"></a>3. Selecting Your Tech Stack</h2><p>Next, it’s time to choose the technologies that will help you achieve your app’s functions. Personally, I love using React for the front end, and I’m a big fan of FastAPI and Flask for the back end. For example, when I wanted to create a live website where users could send messages with meme names, I used this prompt:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I want to make a Python script that will host live on a website. Maybe use React to build the front end. On the website, users can send messages that contain the name of the meme. Then the message will go into the live, and the website will play the sound of the meme until any user interrupts it by sending &#x27;drop&#x27; to play the sound of an iron tube dropping sound. What module am I using?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>AI suggested several options, and I decided to go with FastAPI using WebSocket for real-time communication, which fit my needs perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="4-Planning-the-Project"><a href="#4-Planning-the-Project" class="headerlink" title="4. Planning the Project"></a>4. Planning the Project</h2><p>With your tech stack in place, it’s time to create a rough plan for how you’ll build your app. Having a structured outline makes a world of difference. <strong>This rough plan keeps AI from forgetting the original goal.</strong> Prompt AI to develop a plan based on the specified desired functions and features.</p>
<h2 id="5-Coding-with-AI"><a href="#5-Coding-with-AI" class="headerlink" title="5. Coding with AI"></a>5. Coding with AI</h2><p>Now comes the fun part—coding! I’ve found that AI is most effective when you start with simple tasks. <strong>Begin with basic functions and gradually tackle more complex features.</strong> If you find the app getting too complicated, take the reins on the overall code and let AI assist with smaller segments instead of the full code.</p>
<p>For instance, I had AI help me set up routes in my FastAPI project first, and then add more detailed function later. </p>
<h2 id="6-Testing-and-Troubleshooting"><a href="#6-Testing-and-Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="6. Testing and Troubleshooting"></a>6. Testing and Troubleshooting</h2><p>Test everything locally. If something isn’t working right, don’t panic—just pivot to troubleshooting. <strong>Describe what is going wrong to the AI as detailed as you can.</strong> When I ran into an issue with an icon not displaying in my meme app, AI provided insights that helped me resolve a CSS problem I had missed.</p>
<h2 id="7-Enhancing-Design-and-User-Experience"><a href="#7-Enhancing-Design-and-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="7. Enhancing Design and User Experience"></a>7. Enhancing Design and User Experience</h2><p>Aesthetics matter! After coding, it’s time to make your app visually appealing. Prompt AI using keywords ‘modern’, ‘reactive’, etc. Provide enough detail to AI for how the buttons, font look like. For my bird conservation blog, AI helped me select color schemes that really enhanced the look and feel of the site.</p>
<h2 id="8-Conclusion"><a href="#8-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="8. Conclusion"></a>8. Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, integrating AI into my coding workflow has made the process not only easier but also more enjoyable. By following this structured approach—from ideation to design—you can harness AI as your third hand in app development. I encourage you to give it a try and share your experiences or any questions you might have.</p>
<h2 id="Some-Examples"><a href="#Some-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Some Examples"></a>Some Examples</h2><p>These are some applications that I completely used AI to make:</p>
