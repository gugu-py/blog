<p>Anger Drains Energy, But Relying on It Is Worse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always considered myself someone who values reason, and I’ve even pursued a career where I not only have to be reasonable but also teach others to be the same. As a result, I often find myself in situations where reason seems utterly useless. If I were never reasonable, this wouldn’t bother me. If most people were reasonable, I wouldn’t feel so anxious. Last year, I saw a news report about a security guard stabbing a food delivery worker to death. My first reaction was: someone is being unreasonable. This summer, I saw news about a bank president killing his superior and a woman in a Range Rover assaulting someone for not yielding. I realized that unreasonable people come from all walks of life, regardless of gender or class. More recently, I’ve been reading news about the back-and-forth rocket attacks between Israel and Iran-backed forces, along with various commentary driven by preconceived biases, and I realized there are barely any people left in the world who care about being reasonable. <strong>Even I, at times, don’t feel like being reasonable.</strong></p>
<p>Gradually, I’ve come to realize that getting angry doesn’t solve problems—it only creates new ones. However, by creating new problems, there’s a chance the other party might change their attitude, if only out of fear that things might escalate further. Whether it gets better or worse is another matter, but the turning point often comes from this. There’s a saying: “When you lose it, the world becomes quiet.” But every time I lose my temper, I feel completely drained—not only mentally but also physically, with noticeable symptoms like a sore throat, headache, and chest tightness. So, I always remind myself to stay calm and not get angry, no matter the situation. Does it work? If it did, I wouldn’t be writing this post.</p>
<p>A few years ago, there was a popular book called <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>. While I admire the author, I can’t help but feel disheartened. From my personal experience and what I’ve witnessed, violence is often the most effective way of communicating. From warring countries exchanging missiles to two ordinary people hurling insults, from physical altercations to online keyboard warriors—violence is everywhere in our communication. And, sadly, violence often yields immediate results. Forget about grand narratives of one country defeating another. Just look at everyday examples: when a classroom of students is noisy, a teacher yells, and they quiet down—that yell is a form of violence. Or when a child won’t stop misbehaving, and a parent shouts or even threatens to hit them (many parents in the past would resort to physical punishment)—these are all violent forms of communication, yet they seem to work (at least on the surface). In romantic relationships or marriages, cold wars or full-blown fights are common forms of violent communication.</p>
<p>In today’s increasingly law-abiding society, it’s rare for adults to resort to direct physical violence. Instead, they’re more likely to use money or power to exert violence. Many netizens believe that “capital” is the most evil force in the world, capable of unleashing violence without question. From my experience, I’m more fearful of “power,” which is the most dangerous form of violence. I’ve seen people, even with small amounts of power, wantonly unleash violence on those with lower status—making work difficult, insulting their character, and manipulating them psychologically (often referred to as “PUA”). What terrifies me the most is that this form of violent communication is highly effective for those under their control. They become terrified, and for the person in power, this method works.</p>
<p>As adults, it’s tragic that we only talk about interests and not reason. What’s even more tragic is that even when you want to be reasonable, there’s no place for it. Gradually, you start to lose faith in reason, in others, and even in yourself. As a result, many people come to embrace <strong>Social Darwinism</strong>—talking about the “dark forest” and saying things like “truth is only within the range of cannons” .</p>
<p>I might be a bit of an oddball. Although I live within the “range of cannons”—whether I get hit depends entirely on the mood of the one firing—I refuse to believe the world is just a “dark forest.” Because I’ve noticed that those who constantly talk about the “law of the jungle” are usually the “weak prey”—only with varying degrees of weakness. It’s like <strong>Ah Q</strong>, who bullied a nun , but how many people bullied Ah Q? In <em>The True Story of Ah Q</em>, Master Zhao could swagger around the village, but in the end, his home was ransacked as well .</p>
<p>People raised in an environment of “violent communication” often only know how to communicate violently, especially with those they feel they can dominate. On the flip side, if someone communicates with you violently, it’s likely because they’ve been subjected to violence elsewhere. </p>
<p>If I reflect on myself: I’ve inflicted violence on others, and I’ve also suffered from the violence of others. The “effectiveness” of violence is like a nightmare—it lingers and is impossible to shake off.</p>

<h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2><p>In a world where technology can craft more evocative <strong>love letters</strong> than ordinary human beings, the authenticity of expressing love fades. As people recognize that others rely on AI to articulate their feelings, traditional love letters vanish, making the act of showing love increasingly difficult and rendering emotional expression itself <strong>devalued</strong>. In a society increasingly defined by technology and <strong>commodification</strong>, we risk losing the essence of what it means to be human, as reflected in <strong>Foucault’s</strong> ideas, the narrative of <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>, and the implications of technological advancement.</p>
<h2 id="2-Foucault’s-Perspective-on-Power-and-Knowledge"><a href="#2-Foucault’s-Perspective-on-Power-and-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="2. Foucault’s Perspective on Power and Knowledge"></a>2. Foucault’s Perspective on Power and Knowledge</h2><h3 id="2-1-Power-as-Omnipresent"><a href="#2-1-Power-as-Omnipresent" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Power as Omnipresent"></a>2.1 Power as Omnipresent</h3><p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> posits that power is not merely held by institutions; rather, it is diffused and pervasive throughout society. This notion challenges us to recognize how societal structures shape <strong>identity</strong> and experiences. In contemporary culture, technology acts as a new form of power, influencing our interactions and perceptions of self.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Knowledge-as-Constructed"><a href="#2-2-Knowledge-as-Constructed" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Knowledge as Constructed"></a>2.2 Knowledge as Constructed</h3><p>Foucault argues that knowledge is intertwined with power; it shapes our understanding of truth and reality. The entities that control knowledge—be they corporations or tech giants—dictate what is considered valid, often limiting individual autonomy and genuine understanding. This dynamic is especially relevant in the digital age, where information is commodified and easily manipulated.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Narrative-of-Cyberpunk-Edgerunners"><a href="#3-The-Narrative-of-Cyberpunk-Edgerunners" class="headerlink" title="3. The Narrative of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners"></a>3.

As he adopts cybernetic modifications, he faces the paradox of becoming more powerful while simultaneously losing his authentic self. This mirrors the broader societal trend where technology offers convenience at the expense of genuine identity.</p>
<h3 id="3-2-Emotional-Superficiality"><a href="#3-2-Emotional-Superficiality" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Emotional Superficiality"></a>3.2 Emotional Superficiality</h3><p>The series poignantly illustrates how relationships are affected in a commodified world. As characters increasingly rely on AI-generated interactions, the <strong>devaluation</strong> of genuine emotional connections becomes apparent. The once-vibrant act of expressing love is overshadowed by artificial constructs, rendering human emotions less meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="4-The-Pessimistic-Outlook-A-Cultural-Decline"><a href="#4-The-Pessimistic-Outlook-A-Cultural-Decline" class="headerlink" title="4. The Pessimistic Outlook: A Cultural Decline"></a>4.

The convenience of digital communication often leads to superficial engagements that lack depth and emotional resonance. This shift poses a threat to the richness of human interactions.</p>
<h3 id="4-2-The-Future-of-Human-Relationships"><a href="#4-2-The-Future-of-Human-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="4.2 The Future of Human Relationships"></a>4.2 The Future of Human Relationships</h3><p>Speculating on a future dominated by technology, we may find ourselves in a world where emotional expressions are reduced to mere algorithms. The implications are troubling: the fabric of human relationships could unravel, as genuine connections are replaced by calculated responses.</p>
<h3 id="4-3-The-Risk-of-Relativism"><a href="#4-3-The-Risk-of-Relativism" class="headerlink" title="4.3 The Risk of Relativism"></a>4.3 The Risk of Relativism</h3><p>Finally, the pervasive influence of technology raises concerns about the loss of <strong>objective truths</strong> and values. In a society increasingly driven by individual narratives shaped by algorithms, we risk fostering a relativistic worldview where meaning and morality become fluid concepts, further complicating our understanding of humanity.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Reflecting on humanity’s trajectory, we must grapple with the implications of technology on our understanding of self and others. As we navigate this landscape, it is crucial to seek authentic connections and critically examine the influence of technology on our lives. In doing so, we can strive to preserve the essence of our humanity amidst the encroaching shadows of commodification and emotional devaluation. </p>
<p>In an age where technology has the potential to inspire emotions better than we can, the challenge remains: how do we reclaim the value of authentic human expression?</p>

Corruption into Evil as a Problem"></a>1. Corruption into Evil as a Problem</h3><p>From an empirical standpoint, “corruption into evil” refers to the story pattern of “falling into evil.” Although this concept was originally straightforward and precise, it has become a self-evident term through widespread dissemination. When we mention “corruption into evil,” it immediately evokes associations with explicit elements in various erotic databases. Yet, precisely because of this almost reflexive reaction, the essence of “corruption into evil” is obscured.</p>
<p>With some experience reading such stories, one can easily establish a classification of “corruption into evil” narratives.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-1ed4a3ba2118066a8cc4d20316a9c3b9.webp" alt="Classification of Corruption into Evil"></p>
<p>(Image from the MoeWiki “Corruption into Evil” entry)</p>
<p>This classification, while detailed, doesn’t solve the fundamental question of what constitutes the essence of “corruption into evil.” In fact, this detailed categorization of storylines can sometimes obscure the essence even further. What’s important about “corruption into evil” is not whether the fall is voluntary or involuntary. What drives both the authors’ creative desire and the readers’ interest is the process itself. By comparing stories across these categories, we can discover the core commonality of “corruption into evil.”</p>
<p>Take brainwashing as an example. In many “corruption into evil” stories, brainwashing is a common trope, where the female character’s subjectivity is replaced through some “deus ex machina” technology, turning her into a “sexual subject” actively pursuing desires. However, we’re not unfamiliar with such tropes: the brainwashing process often gets deliberately interrupted, and as the character regains some resistance to indulgence, she begins to doubt herself. This doubt eventually leads her to succumb to desire, or she becomes an active pursuer of it.</p>
<p>In this interruption of the brainwashing process, we observe a certain level of “volition.” Although the situation has been pre-designed, the character’s choice to face desire is an act of volition. So, returning to the topic of the essence of “corruption into evil,” can we conclude that regardless of how the story is framed, the essence lies in “actively choosing to become a subject of indulgence”?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-The-Reproduction-of-Corruption-into-Evil"><a href="#2-The-Reproduction-of-Corruption-into-Evil" class="headerlink" title="2. The Reproduction of Corruption into Evil"></a>2. The Reproduction of Corruption into Evil</h3><p>To further explore this hypothesis, we can examine the standards that define whether “corruption into evil” has been successfully achieved. In the structural linguistics of <strong>Ferdinand de Saussure</strong>, meaning is established through the difference between two terms. In the context of “corruption into evil,” if “evil” equates to indulgence, chaos, and promiscuity, then “good” naturally represents restraint, abstinence, and purity.</p>
<p>In many “corruption into evil” stories, the contrast between good and evil is a key narrative strategy. However, this common trope can cause us to overlook a fundamental premise: the beginning of “corruption into evil” coincides with the appearance of evil itself.</p>
<p>What does this mean? In these stories, evil equals indulgence, an animalistic existence devoid of reason. But merely being animalistic isn’t necessarily problematic. The issue arises when these characters impose their “evil” (in this case, sexual desire) on others. In other words, animals have their own desires and behaviors, and that isn’t inherently a problem. It’s only when they interact with humans (sexually) that this becomes an issue. (In bestiality stories, the animal is rarely the one initiating sex; more often, the human characters are portrayed as the instigators.)</p>
<p>Thus, the standard for determining the success of corruption into evil is seen in the clash between good and evil in the story. These narratives often follow a cycle: evil arises, leading the good characters to fall into evil, thus becoming new “corruptors.” This cycle is exemplified in works like the <em>Kantai Collection</em> series, where corrupted ship girls confront their former comrades, hinting at future corruption. Therefore, the core of the story isn’t just “actively choosing to become a subject of indulgence” but also “spreading the perceived rationale of this choice to others.”</p>
<p>This is what we call the <strong>reproduction of corruption into evil</strong>—sometimes referred to by fans as “chain corruption.”</p>

<h3 id="3-Subjectivity-and-Corruption-into-Evil-as-an-AIE"><a href="#3-Subjectivity-and-Corruption-into-Evil-as-an-AIE" class="headerlink" title="3. Subjectivity and Corruption into Evil as an AIE"></a>3. Subjectivity and Corruption into Evil as an AIE</h3><p>“Corruption into evil” works often feature <strong>NTR (Netorare)</strong> elements. (As discussed earlier, the reproduction of corruption into evil requires multiple “good” characters as a premise, so NTR is almost inevitable, as seen in works like <em>Love Mary, the Holy Angel of Love</em> by Sora Kuuki.) However, not all NTR stories are about corruption into evil. The key distinction between the two lies in the reproduction of corruption.</p>
<p>Through extensive reading of such works, one can tentatively conclude that <strong>characters in “corruption into evil” stories possess a strong sense of subjectivity</strong>.</p>
<p>This subjectivity stands in contrast to objectification seen in other works, such as <strong>petification</strong> or <strong>objectification</strong>, where characters are mere objects of desire. In <em>Elona: The End of the Female Knight</em>, for example, the protagonist isn’t simply objectified. Although she becomes a sexualized being, she retains her autonomy and tactical expertise. She joins the “evil” faction by liberating her sexual morality, thus maintaining her subjectivity even after falling into corruption.</p>
<p>However, some may argue: How can this be called subjectivity? Even if the character seems self-aware, there is always some external force driving their actions, whether brainwashing or “awakening.” This brings us to the final clarification of the concept of “corruption into evil.”</p>
<p>We can say that the subjectivity in these stories is indeed a product—produced by an external force. Here, we find a similarity between “corruption into evil” and <strong>Louis Althusser’s</strong> concept of the <strong>Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)</strong>.</p>
<p>The key difference between the ISA and the <strong>Repressive State Apparatus (RSA)</strong> lies in their focus on ideology. “Corruption into evil” functions as an ISA—it produces “subjects” through ideological dissemination. Violence, though present, plays a secondary role. The primary goal is to propagate an ideology (in these stories, attitudes toward desire). Interestingly, the subjects produced by the ISA don’t recognize the ideology itself. Similarly, those who fall into corruption believe their new state is perfectly normal and even desirable, seeing those who differ from them as abnormal or unhappy.</p>
<p>In schools, families, or religious institutions (as ISAs), subjectivity is produced similarly, where individuals don’t question the ideology they’ve internalized. “Corruption into evil,” as a fictional ISA, produces characters who see indulgence as natural and inevitable. In fact, this form of release (especially ideological) isn’t necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>Algorithmic complexity — everyone’s favorite concept for geeking out and squeezing out performance.</p>
<p>You have a problem to solve. You come up with a solution and it’s O(n^2). You see that it won’t work and need to make it better. You tweak it a bit and get to linear complexity — O(n). You’re happy because things are looking brighter.</p>
<p>You sleep on it, and wake up with an epiphany that brings the algo complexity down to logarithmic O(log(n)) and you’re feeling pretty good about yourself. Later in the week you read a paper and realize that you can bring it down to constant time — O(1). You are done. It won’t get better than this.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>You haven’t tried going for O(zero).</p>
<p><img data-src="https://koliber.com/static/images/articles/o-zero.webp" alt="O(zero) reigns supreme"></p>
<p>What? Zero time? “That’s impossible”, you say. Never heard about it. Your hard core computer science professor said that constant time is as good as it gets. All of your career you heard that the best you can do is O(1).</p>
<p>It’s been there all along, but it was called other things.</p>
<p>Some code does not need to execute at all. Some tools can be thrown away. Some things don’t need to be done at all, and you’ll still accomplish a similar of better result, if you tweak something else.</p>
<p>You might have heard the adage that the fastest code is the code that does not get called at all? That’s what O(zero) is!</p>
<p>One of the most powerful questions an engineer can ask themselves is “Is there a way to get X done without doing this work at all?” Surprisingly, sometimes the answer is “yes”.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we do something long and complicated, where not doing anything might be a good enough solution. Sometimes we run a process once per minute, when once-per-month would suffice. Sometimes we build complicated mechanisms that are used but whose benefits are never needed (YAGNI is a close relative of O(zero) ).</p>
<p>Do you want to be a 10x engineer? Sometimes deciding that something does not need to be done at all provides more efficiency than doing something useless 100 times more efficiently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If I don’t have to do something, I won’t, and if I have to do it, I’ll do it quickly.</strong><br>—— energy-saving philosophy of Houtarou Oreki, from <em>Hyouka</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, a friend of mine told me he experienced brain fog more often than before. He came to ask me about the problem of <strong>reducing  energy consumption</strong>.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, I also encountered the problem of becoming drained because of loads of work to do. I developed a few strategies that worked well at that time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Periodic goofing off</strong>, that is to periodically take rest during class without missing important content. I always flip pens in class.</li>
<li><strong>Sustaining an optimal thinking speed</strong>, that is to know the current status of myself and control the mental pace to reduce unnecessary energy waste. I remember slowing down my pace during Maths class to ensure I didn’t burn out before the end of the day<del>(because I have already mastered the skills)</del>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those strategies helped me a lot, as I was able to balancing the mountains of assignments and the responsibilties of a students’ union president. However, recently, I leveled up to high school, and these strategies just do not work well now.</p>
<p>Things changed a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>The classes have <strong>denser information</strong>, which teachers repeat less and have faster pace. For instance, my history teacher talks so fast that I cannot afford a break. Thus, <em>Periodic goofing off</em> fails. </li>
<li><strong>More things get on my mind</strong>, like the more flexible deadlines, social meetings, etc., as the degrees of freedom increased exponentially in high school. This makes me less likely to be aware of my current status, thus impeding me from <em>adjusting my thinking speed</em>. </li>
<li><strong>The daily activities</strong> are harder and require more thinking resources. Especially socially, as we have a non-fixed class system, where social network becomes more dispersed, and I struggled to make new friends at first. <del>Maybe I should write a blog on how to make friends in a dispersed social network.</del></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the circumstance has become much more complicated, I developed ways to deal with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce.</strong> This means you do not do (or do less) unnecessary things, like watching viral videos. Also, this refers to distribute workload to other people, like making powerpoints. Activate <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/goblin-mode">Goblin Mode</a> as frequently as possible. For example, I stopped watching YouTube videos during study breaks and instead used that time to do nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Rest actively.</strong> This is an evolution of <em>periodic goofing off</em>. With more degrees of freedom to plan, you plan time for naps in afternoons. I started taking short naps, which helped me recharge and stay focused during evening study <del>and gaming</del>.</li>
<li><strong>Do Cardio exercise.</strong> This is a long-term investigation to increase your max stamina. It might make you tired in a short term, but this helps you in a long run. I used to run 1km every morning in middle school but stopped due to academic pressure. I noticed I got out of breath more easily when stressed. After running 1km weekly for a month, I feel noticeably better.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope anyone finds this useful.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><em>Castle</em> is an unfinished work by Kafka. Its unfinished state is not detrimental to its major theme, but rather it strengthens its sense of absurdity, symbolizing an infinite fruitless loop that the protagonist pursues for the mission as a land surveyor.</p>
<p>In it a protagonist known only as “K.” arrives in a village and struggles to gain access to the mysterious authorities who govern it from a castle supposedly owned by Graf Westwest.</p>
<h2 id="Author"><a href="#Author" class="headerlink" title="Author"></a>Author</h2><p><strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and writer from Prague. He is widely regarded as a <strong>major figure of 20th-century literature</strong>.<br><img data-src="https://blog.gu33gu.asia/_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240901100544%201.png" title="a"><br>Kafka was born into a middle-class German-speaking <strong>Czech Jewish family</strong> in Prague.</p>
<p>He <strong>burned an estimated 90 percent of his total work</strong> due to his persistent struggles with self-doubt. Much of the remaining 10 percent is lost or otherwise unpublished.</p>
<h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>Kafka began writing the novel on the evening of 27 January 1922. He died before he could finish the novel.</p>
<p>His friend <strong>Max Brod</strong> published most of his work after Kafka’s death(although not instructed to do so). In order to ready it for publishing, Brod <strong>heavily changed</strong> the text. </p>
<p>The publisher soon realized the translations were “bad” and in 1940 desired a “completely different approach”. <strong>Malcolm Pasley</strong><br>and a team of scholars <strong>restored the original German text to its full and incomplete state</strong>, including Kafka’s unique punctuation, considered critical to the style.</p>
<h2 id="Title"><a href="#Title" class="headerlink" title="Title"></a>Title</h2><p>The title <strong>Das Schloss</strong> may be translated as “the castle”, “the palace”, or “lock”. It is also phonetically close to <strong>der Schluss</strong> (“conclusion” or “end”).</p>
<h2 id="Theme"><a href="#Theme" class="headerlink" title="Theme"></a>Theme</h2><h3 id="“Kafkaesque”"><a href="#“Kafkaesque”" class="headerlink" title="“Kafkaesque”"></a>“Kafkaesque”</h3><p><strong>“Kafkaesque”</strong> refers to situations that are surreal, nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical, involving oppressive and often incomprehensible forces. This term captures the essence of Franz Kafka’s literary style, where characters find themselves in disorienting and frustrating circumstances that defy reason.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Absurdism</strong>: Depicting a world where characters encounter irrational and illogical obstacles, thwarting their pursuit of meaning or purpose. In <em>The Castle</em>, K.’s attempts to fulfill his role are endlessly obstructed, reflecting <strong>the absurdity of trying to impose logic on a chaotic universe</strong>. (confusing bureaucratic procedures, low effectiveness of the system, temptation(Frieda), and indifferent villigers)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Existential Absurdity</strong>: Kafkaesque also conveys existential absurdity, where characters grapple with a universe indifferent to their search for meaning. K.’s continuous struggles against inexplicable barriers exemplify this, highlighting the futility of seeking clarity or purpose in an indifferent reality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Kafkaesque experience encompass a range of obstacles, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Environment</strong>: A cold, unwelcoming setting that adds to the protagonist’s isolation and struggle.</li>
<li><strong>Indifferent Villagers</strong>: Characters who are unhelpful or dismissive, intensifying feelings of alienation and frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Relationships</strong>: Complex and ambiguous interactions that complicate the protagonist’s efforts rather than providing solace or support.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Obfuscation</strong>: Alienating and dehumanizing procedure that largely impedes K from working effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Existentialism"><a href="#Existentialism" class="headerlink" title="Existentialism"></a>Existentialism</h4><p><strong>Simone de Beauvoir</strong>, who considered The Castle a pioneering work of existentialism, said of it, “Kafka spoke to us about ourselves.” It seems somehow proper the story has no ending, that the events recounted seemingly form part of an infinite series of occurrences, of which only a small segment has found its way onto the pages of a novel.</p>
<h3 id="Salvation-Bible"><a href="#Salvation-Bible" class="headerlink" title="Salvation (Bible)"></a>Salvation (Bible)</h3><p>One interpretation (Originally by Max Brod) of K.’s struggle to contact the castle is that it represents a man’s search for salvation. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Quest for Authority (Castle&#x2F;God)</strong>: K.’s attempts to access the castle mirror humanity’s search for connection with God, akin to the biblical quest for divine approval and entry into heaven.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Unknowable Divine</strong>: The castle’s mysterious and inaccessible nature symbolizes the incomprehensible nature of God, reflecting the biblical idea that divine intentions are beyond human understanding.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grace and Redemption</strong>: K.’s struggles suggest that favor from the castle, like divine salvation, cannot be achieved through human effort alone, echoing the biblical notion of grace as a gift from God.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alienation and Pilgrimage</strong>: K.’s feelings of not belonging and his relentless search for meaning resemble the spiritual journey of believers who see life as a pilgrimage toward a divine home, similar to the biblical view of life on earth as a temporary journey.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Theme of Judgment</strong>: The arbitrary judgment K. faces parallels the biblical theme of divine judgment, where the reasons for divine favor or disfavor are often unclear.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ambiguity and Meaning</strong>: The unresolved narrative in <em>The Castle</em> reflects the uncertainty of the spiritual quest for salvation and mirrors the ambiguity in understanding divine will in the Bible.</p>
</li>
</ol>

          <p>“Do you know what is the greatest and worst invention that humans ever made was? Television.”</p>
<p><strong>“Telivision controls people using information and steals their sence of reality. Yes, television itself is a religion. TV has created people that are easily, fooled by such an idiotic fantasy.”</strong></p>

<p>Cowboy Bebop was really a van-guard in 20 century. The most stunning thing about it is that it outlooked how media(‘television’) controls people’s thought. True, the media nowadays really has become a part of our reality, although they are actually not. This reminds me of the concept called ‘<strong>Hyperreality</strong>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hyperreality</strong> is a concept in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism" title="Post-structuralism">post-structuralism</a> that refers to the process of the evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of confusion between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)" title="Sign (semiotics)">signs</a> and symbols invented to stand in for reality, and direct perceptions of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality" title="Consensus reality">consensus reality</a>. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which, because of the compression of perceptions of reality in culture and media, what is generally regarded as real and what is understood as fiction are seamlessly blended together in experiences so that there is no longer any clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins. - <em>Wikipedia Hyperreality</em></p>
