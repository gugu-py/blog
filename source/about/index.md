> In the hidden blue, I find my voice.

**I am HiddenBlue, a piece of soul fragment.**

Reasons why I started this blog:
- To counter AI generated Content Farm(Rubbish)
- Writing makes my thought rational. (I hope so)
- To share freely.

My other content/projects:

- [Birding School](https://weibo.com/birdingschool?is_all=1): a youth-led blog and environmental initiative that uses birdwatching and public engagement to inspire young people and their families to care about birds and biodiversity.
- [Benjamin Franklin Meets Chinese Wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/@BenjaminMeets/shorts) and [former account](https://www.youtube.com/@Richard-LetMeet): a cross-cultural project that imagines dialogues between Benjamin Franklin and Chinese (and other global) thinkers to explore shared ideas.
