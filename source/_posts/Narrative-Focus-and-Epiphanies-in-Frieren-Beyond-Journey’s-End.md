## Narrative Focus and Epiphanies in *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*

> Think of the typical heroic epics—like the story of Joan of Arc. These tales are elevated to a near-sacred status, yet the memories most cherished by the heroes themselves often vanish into the river of history, forgotten and overlooked.

The anime *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* adapts the manga by Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe, weaving a tale that begins where most epics end. (**Plot summary**: After a ten-year journey, a hero’s party defeats the Demon King. The story picks up long after, exploring life in the aftermath of such a legendary adventure.) 

Using the concept of “epiphanies,” the series merges objective clock time with subjective psychological time. Through a blend of chronological and retrospective storytelling, it employs a thousand-year lens to immortalize fleeting, overlooked moments—those "ordinary" times that turn extraordinary when viewed in hindsight.

### 1. A Chronological Perspective

#### 1.1 Frieren’s Unique Sense of Time and Emotional Perception

> From dismissing the significance of a decade-long adventure, to showing indifference even at Himmel’s funeral, Frieren’s initial reactions reveal her detachment. She rejects Heiter’s request to mentor Fern and initially interacts with Fern with cold distance.

As an elf, Frieren’s perception of time, mortality, and farewells differs vastly from that of humans. 

#### 1.2 The Temporal Clash Between Elves and Humans

> Celebrating the defeat of the Demon King with a banquet, the promise to reunite in “just 50 years” for a meteor shower, and Frieren’s relentless search for rare Cazue grass, spanning years—all highlight the tension between human brevity and elven eternity.

For humans, “stillness resembles eternity, and days stretch like years.” For Frieren, the reverse holds true: “eternity blossoms endlessly, while years feel like fleeting days.” Much like a mayfly and a tortoise, their lifespans render mutual understanding elusive.

#### 1.3 Narrative Focus

French literary theorist Gérard Genette introduced the concept of **focalization** in his work *Narrative Discourse*. Focalization asks: who is the psychological or emotional lens through which the narrative is filtered? Whose eyes and mind color the story being told?

In *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*, the narrative often adopts the perspective of Frieren, filtering the world through her unique sense of time and emotional depth. This approach enables viewers to experience events through her evolving consciousness and inner reflections.

> The ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King occupies only a brief segment of the series. The story’s focus shifts to Frieren’s return to the same locations, where the traces of her former companions are fading into legend, leaving behind hollow myths.

By juxtaposing human and elven perceptions of time, the series deepens its exploration of narrative focus and temporal dissonance.

### 2. Epiphanies and the Role of Flashbacks

#### 2.1 What is an Epiphany?

An **epiphany** is a moment of sudden realization—a flash of understanding that disrupts the normal flow of time in the story. These instances are pivotal for Frieren, as they often freeze the narrative, revealing key shifts in her psychological state.

Epiphanies in *Frieren* connect the sequential and retrospective layers of the story, intertwining moments from the hero’s tale with her present journey.

#### 2.2 How Are Epiphanies Triggered?

Epiphanies are frequently linked to objects in the physical world. As Frieren observes various scenes or people, her gaze eventually settles on something specific—a seemingly ordinary object imbued with profound meaning. These objects hold the power to unearth hidden memories or insights, drawing the audience into the emotional depth of the moment.

Examples include the Cazue grass, a rusted ring, or a weathered statue. Each item serves as a focal point that triggers flashbacks and recollections.

#### 2.3 What Do Epiphanies Uncover?

In *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End*, epiphanies grant the protagonist new insights, propelling the story forward while adding layers of emotional depth to the narrative. On a broader scale, these moments bring new meaning to the world itself.

> One such scene involves Himmel’s memory: Frieren revisits a field of daisies where she recalls Himmel once gifting her a flower crown. Cleaning his statue, she uses her magic to recreate the meadow, placing a wreath of Cazue grass—a flower symbolizing gratitude—on the statue.

Through these acts, Frieren not only honors the past but also renews the audience’s reverence for the hero’s legacy.

### 3. Mastering the Art of Detail

Genette also argues that time in narrative chains is both consistent and malleable. While clock time remains steady, storytelling techniques—like sequencing and montage—distort the perception of time, adding emotional depth.

Take Episode 2 as an example.

Guided by a seed mouse, Frieren and Fern discover Cazue grass atop a lighthouse. Through a mix of long shots and slow motion, the scene magnifies the moment, giving viewers a level of detail and emotional resonance impossible to capture in real-time. **Time is stretched**, creating a poetic impression that lingers in the viewer’s mind.

> When Frieren gazes at Himmel’s statue and recalls adjusting his pose, the scene’s physical clock only accounts for a glance. Yet within this brief moment, half a year of narrative time passes. Similarly, when Fern asks why Frieren enjoys magic, her simple response—“Because there was a fool who praised me for it”—triggers a cascade of memories.

Ordinary moments, overlooked in their time, leave eternal imprints in memory.

### 4. Conclusion: What’s Your Time Lens?

*Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* offers a thousand-year perspective through the eyes of an elf, while works like *The Story of My Life* by Helen Keller provide a contrasting lens—just three days of vision.

What lens do you use to focus your narrative? A millennium? A century? Three days? Or the fleeting instant of the present?  

Each perspective carries its own power to turn the ordinary into something eternal.
