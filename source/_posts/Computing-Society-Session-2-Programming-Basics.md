### **Session 2: Variables, Data Types, Control Structures, and Basic Operations**  
**Total Time: 60 minutes**

---

### **2.1 Understanding Variables and Data Types** (15 minutes)  
#### Explanation:  
🔹 **Variables** store data that can be reused throughout a program. In Python, they're dynamically typed, while C++ requires explicit typing.  
🔸 **Data Types** determine what kind of data a variable holds:  
- **📊 Integers (int)**: Whole numbers.  
- **🔢 Floats (float)**: Numbers with decimals.  
- **📝 Strings (str)**: Text enclosed in quotes.  
- **✅ Booleans (bool)**: True/False values.  

#### Activity Breakdown:  
- **(5 minutes)** Introduction to variables in Python and C++.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Assign values to variables and print them.  
    - Example: `age = 16` in Python; `int age = 16;` in C++.

- **(5 minutes)** Overview of common data types.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Print different types of variables.  
    - Example: `num1 = 5` (int), `pi = 3.14` (float), `name = "Alex"` (string), `is_student = True` (bool).

- **(5 minutes)**  
  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Design a **data structure** to store the information of a **competition**. The competition should have teams, team members, and scores. Use **dictionaries** in Python or **structs** in C++.  
    - Example: In Python, use a dictionary where team names are keys, and values are lists of tuples with member names and scores.  
    - In C++, use structs and a map.

### **2.2 Basic Arithmetic and Logical Operations** (10 minutes)  
#### Explanation:  
- **➕ Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic math on numbers using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.  
- **✅ Logical Operations**: Compare values using `and`, `or`, and `not`.  
- **💡 XOR (exclusive OR)**: Returns true if exactly **one** condition is true, but not both.

#### Activity Breakdown:  
- **(5 minutes)** Arithmetic operations.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.  
    - Example: `result = 10 + 5` (Python) or `int result = 10 + 5;` (C++).

- **(5 minutes)** Logical operations.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Write a program that uses `and`, `or`, `not` to compare boolean values.  
    - Example: `is_even = (num % 2 == 0)` and `is_positive = (num > 0)`.

- **Challenging Task** 🏆: Achieve **XOR** using only `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### **2.3 Control Structures: Loops and Conditionals** (20 minutes)  
#### Explanation:  
- **⚙️ Conditionals**: Let the program decide what code to run based on conditions using `if`, `else`, `elif` in Python, or `if`, `else if`, `else` in C++.  
- **🔁 Loops**: Repeat code using `for` and `while` loops. A `for` loop repeats a fixed number of times, while a `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is true.

#### Activity Breakdown:  
- **(10 minutes)** Conditionals.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Create a program that categorizes a number (grade) using `if-else`.  
    - Example: Check if a score is `>=90` (A), `>=80` (B), etc.

- **(10 minutes)** Loops.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using `for` and `while`.  
    - Example: `for i in range(1, 11): print(i)` in Python.

- **Challenging Task** 🏆: Write a program that checks if any character in a given string appears twice using **two loops**.  
    - Additional Challenge 💡: Can you **optimize it** to **O(n)** time complexity?

### **2.4 Hands-On Practice: Simple Calculations and Control Flow** (15 minutes)  
#### Explanation:  
- Now, students apply their knowledge by building simple programs that combine all the above concepts.

#### Activity Breakdown:  
- **(10 minutes)** Simple calculator or number guessing game.  
  - **Noobs Task**: Create a basic calculator that asks for two numbers and an operation (+, -, \*, /), then performs the calculation.

- **(5 minutes)**  
  - **Challenging Task** 🏆: Use a single `int` to check if a character in a string appears twice, achieving **O(n)** time complexity using **bit manipulation (数位压缩)**.  
    - Tip 💡: Use **bitwise operations** to track character occurrences.

### **Wrap-Up and Q&A** (5 minutes)  
- Summarize the session with a quick review of key concepts 📚.  
- Open the floor for questions and additional clarifications 🙋‍♂️.
