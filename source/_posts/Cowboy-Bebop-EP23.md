"Do you know what is the greatest and worst invention that humans ever made was? Television."

**"Telivision controls people using information and steals their sence of reality. Yes, television itself is a religion. TV has created people that are easily, fooled by such an idiotic fantasy."**

Cowboy Bebop was really a van-guard in 20 century. The most stunning thing about it is that it outlooked how media('television') controls people's thought. True, the media nowadays really has become a part of our reality, although they are actually not. This reminds me of the concept called '**Hyperreality**'.

> **Hyperreality** is a concept in [post-structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism "Post-structuralism") that refers to the process of the evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of confusion between [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics) "Sign (semiotics)") and symbols invented to stand in for reality, and direct perceptions of [consensus reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality "Consensus reality"). Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which, because of the compression of perceptions of reality in culture and media, what is generally regarded as real and what is understood as fiction are seamlessly blended together in experiences so that there is no longer any clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins. - *Wikipedia Hyperreality*
