- Why did you join the Computing Society Zhixing?
- Your favorite video game or anime!

## What is the Computing Society?

#### Our Aim:
- Create a **cozy, creative, and collaborative** environment. %%(Ask questions, rectify errors in no time)%%
- Encourage contributions to the community through **fun and innovative ideas**.
- Make **friends** while learning new skills.

#### Who We Aspire to Be:
To become an ideal developer, you need to master:
- **Programming skills**
- **Problem-solving and critical thinking**
- **Collaboration and communication**

## Our Structure

### Becoming a Core Team Member
- If youâ€™re able to host at least half a session (30 minutes) and receive positive feedback, you can become a **core team member** (certified by the EL office).

### The Kernel
- The **kernel** is a subset of the core team who not only hosts sessions but also handles budgets, organization, and logistics.

## Activities Overview

### Routine Sessions
*(Images of the sessions)*

### Featured Sessions
- These are hosted by **core team members** or those aspiring to become one.
- For more details about the future content, refer to the **Course Storm file**.

### Your Own Project (?)

- **Budget** may be provided if negotiations with EL are successful (which is usually the case).
- **Human resources** could also be made available (though we can't guarantee it).
- If your project succeeds, we will host a **CS Day** to **publish and promote your work on campus** (we're aiming to beat the Sustainable Council's Hackathon!).

### Journal

- We will **publish** through our own platform.
- The journal will focus on **introducing interesting articles** (original works are also encouraged).
- We need a dedicated person to **consistently play the role of editor and publisher**.
- More details about the journal structure and process are yet to be decided

## Collaborations with Other Zhixings

### Robotix
- Weâ€™ll co-host **Programming Initial Courses** and share learning resources.

### GAL (?)
- Tentative collaboration: Since GAL lacks programmers for their game, we plan to supply resources after the Programming Initial Courses.

### Your Ideas?
- Got a collaboration idea with another Zhixing or organization? We encourage you to bring it forward! 
*(If time permits, we can brainstorm together)*.

2. Make sure to **install Python** and an IDE (editor).
